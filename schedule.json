These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection, and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large datasets by using the back-propagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.  Deep convolutional nets have brought about dramatic improvements in processing images, video, speech and audio, while recurrent nets have shone on sequential data such as text and speech.  Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep learning methods are representation learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.

We adopt a deep recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) for this task, which is originally proposed for object recognition. Different from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), this model has intra-layer recurrent connections in the convolutional layers. Therefore each convolutional layer becomes a two-dimensional recurrent neural network. The units receive constant feed-forward inputs from the previous layer and recurrent inputs from their neighborhoods. While recurrent iterations proceed, the region of context captured by each unit expands. In this way, feature extraction and context modulation are seamlessly integrated, which is different from typical methods that entail separate modules for the two steps. To further utilize the context, a multi-scale RCNN is proposed. Over two benchmark datasets, Standford Background and Sift Flow, the model outperforms many state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency.</div>"

An important computation for reconstruction is the detection of neuronal boundaries. Images acquired by serial section EM, a leading 3D EM technique, are highly anisotropic, with inferior quality along the third dimension. For such images, the 2D max-pooling convolutional network has set the standard for performance at boundary detection. Here we achieve a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations. Following the trend towards deeper networks for object recognition, we use a much deeper network than previously employed for boundary detection. Second, we incorporate 3D as well as 2D filters, to enable computations that use 3D context. Finally, we adopt a recursively trained architecture in which a first network generates a preliminary boundary map that is provided as input along with the original image to a second network that generates a final boundary map. Backpropagation training is accelerated by ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed. Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture could be more generally applicable to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video, and our recursive framework for any image labeling problem.</div>"

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share convolutional features. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 (73.2% mAP) and 2012 (70.4% mAP) using 300 proposals per image.

However, we can train a neural network to address the problem if we restrict our attention to specific object classes (in our case faces and chairs) for which we can gather ample training data. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of rendering rotated objects starting from a single image. The recurrent structure allows our model to capture long- term dependencies along a sequence of transformations, and we demonstrate the quality of its predictions for human faces on the Multi-PIE dataset and for a dataset of 3D chair models, and also show its ability of disentangling latent data factors without using object class labels.</div>"

The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on the project page: \\\\url{http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html}.</div>"

They have a fixed input size and typically perceive only small local contexts of the pixels to be classified as foreground or background. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional Recurrent NNs (MD-RNNs) can perceive the entire spatio-temporal context of each pixel in a few sweeps through all pixels, especially when the RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Despite these theoretical advantages, however, unlike CNNs, previous MD-LSTM variants were hard to parallelise on GPUs. Here we re-arrange the traditional cuboid order of computations in MD-LSTM in pyramidal fashion. The resulting PyraMiD-LSTM is easy to parallelise, especially for 3D data such as stacks of brain slice images. PyraMiD-LSTM achieved best known pixel-wise brain image segmentation results on MRBrainS13 (and competitive results on EM-ISBI12).</div>"

The PGBN&apos;s hidden layers are jointly trained with an upward-downward Gibbs sampler, each iteration of which upward samples Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors starting from the first layer (bottom data layer), and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units starting from the top hidden layer. The gamma-negative binomial process combined with a layer-wise training strategy allows the PGBN to infer the width of each layer given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The PGBN with a single hidden layer reduces to Poisson factor analysis. Example results on text analysis illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the PGBN, whose hidden units are imposed with correlated gamma priors, can add more layers to increase its performance gains over Poisson factor analysis, given the same limit on the width of the first layer. </div>"

In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.</div>"

In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality reduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality.  This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by randomized modification of resolution.  We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling.  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral parameterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model unchanged, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training.</div>"

As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have been studied in the context of time series before.As an example of an unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently. Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed methods.</div>"

Here, we develop automated classifiers for functional identification of retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, based solely on recorded voltage patterns on a large scale array.  We use per-cell classifiers based on features extracted from electrophysiological images (spatiotemporal voltage waveforms) and interspike intervals (autocorrelations). These classifiers achieve high performance in distinguishing between the major ganglion cell classes of the primate retina, but fail in achieving the same accuracy in predicting cell polarities (ON vs. OFF).  We then show how to use indicators of functional coupling within populations of ganglion cells (cross-correlation) to infer cell polarities with a matrix completion algorithm.

We are interested in calibration for structured prediction problems such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, and medical diagnosis. Structured prediction presents new challenges for calibration: the output space is large, and users may issue many types of probability queries (e.g., marginals) on the structured output. We extend the notion of calibration so as to handle various subtleties pertaining to the structured setting,  and then provide a simple recalibration method that trains a binary classifier to predict probabilities of interest. We explore a range of features appropriate for structured recalibration, and demonstrate their efficacy on three real-world datasets.</div>"

In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework to model confidence in perceptual decision making. We show that this model, based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), is able to predict confidence of a decision maker based only on the data available to the experimenter. We test our model on two experiments on confidence-based decision making involving the well-known random dots motion discrimination task.

However, many existing discriminative methods assume that the input data is nearly noise-free, which limits their applications to solve real-world problems. Particularly for disease diagnosis, the data acquired by the neuroimaging devices are always prone to different sources of noise. Robust discriminative models are somewhat scarce and only a few attempts have been made to make them robust against noise or outliers. These methods focus on detecting either the sample-outliers or feature-noises. Moreover, they usually use unsupervised de-noising procedures, or separately de-noise the training and the testing data. All these factors may induce biases in the learning process, and thus limit its performance. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on the least-squares formulation of linear discriminant analysis, which simultaneously detects the sample-outliers and feature-noises. The proposed method operates under a semi-supervised setting, in which both labeled training and unlabeled testing data are incorporated to form the intrinsic geometry of the sample space. Therefore, the violating samples or feature values are identified  as sample-outliers or feature-noises, respectively. We test our algorithm on one synthetic and two brain neurodegenerative databases (particularly for Parkinson&apos;s disease and Alzheimer&apos;s disease). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baseline and state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both accuracy and the area under the ROC curve. </div>"

The use of the tools of Riemannian geometry allows to derive a generic algorithm for any kind of data with smooth constraints, which lie therefore on a Riemannian manifold. Stochastic approximations of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters in this highly non-linear setting.The method is used to estimate a data-driven model of the progressive impairments of cognitive functions during the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Experimental results show that the model correctly put into correspondence the age at which each individual was diagnosed with the disease, thus validating the fact that it effectively estimated a normative scenario of disease progression.

Regular SGVB estimators rely on sampling of parameters once per minibatch of data, and have variance that is constant w.r.t. the minibatch size. The efficiency of such estimators can be drastically improved upon by translating uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence.We find an important connection with regularization by dropout: the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose \\\\emph{variational dropout}, a generalization of Gaussian dropout, but with a more flexibly parameterized posterior, often leading to better generalization.

This paper provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning.

The algorithm constructs adaptively efficient proposal distributions approximating the local beliefs  at each note of the MRF. This is achieved by considering proposal distributions in the exponential family whose parameters are updated iterately in an Expectation Propagation (EP) framework. The proposed particle scheme provides consistent estimation of the LBP marginals as the number of particles increases. We demonstrate that it provides more accurate results than the Particle Belief Propagation (PBP) algorithm of Ihler and McAllester (2009) at a fraction of the computational cost and is additionally more robust empirically. The computational complexity of our algorithm at each iteration is quadratic in the number of particles.

By eliminating the need for explicit inference a more scalable approach to structured output prediction can be achieved, particularly at test time.

Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space.

Here, the difficulty lies in not the model but the supervision, and poor approximations at this stage could lead to following the wrong learning signal entirely. In this paper, we develop a rigorous approach to relaxing the supervision, which yields asymptotically consistent parameter estimates despite altering the supervision. Our approach parameterizes a family of increasingly accurate relaxations, and jointly optimizes both the model and relaxation parameters, while formulating constraints between these parameters to ensure efficient inference. These efficiency constraints allow us to learn in otherwise intractable settings, while asymptotic consistency ensures that we always follow a valid learning signal.</div>"

We introduce term symmetries, which are induced by an evidence set and extend to symmetries over a relational theory. We provide the important special case of term equivalent symmetries, showing that such symmetries can be found in low-degree polynomial time.

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">The Multi-Armed Bandit problem constitutes an archetypal setting for sequential decision-making, permeating multiple domains including engineering, business, and medicine. One of the hallmarks of a bandit setting is the agent&apos;s capacity to explore its environment through active intervention, which contrasts with the ability to collect passive data by estimating associational relationships between actions and payouts. The existence of unobserved confounders, namely unmeasured variables affecting both the action and the outcome variables, implies that these two data-collection modes will in general not coincide. In this paper, we show that formalizing this distinction has conceptual and algorithmic implications to the bandit setting. The current generation of bandit algorithms implicitly try to maximize rewards based on estimation of the experimental distribution, which we show is not always the best strategy to pursue. Indeed, to achieve low regret in certain realistic classes of bandit problems (namely, in the face of unobserved confounders), both experimental and observational quantities are required by the rational agent. After this realization, we propose an optimization metric (employing both experimental and observational distributions) that bandit agents should pursue, and illustrate its benefits over traditional algorithms.</div>"

While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the mean square error (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications.</div>"

The goal is to learn the polynomial by querying the values of $f$. We introduce an active learning framework that is associated with a low query cost and computational runtime. The significant savings are enabled by leveraging sampling strategies based on modern coding theory, specifically, the design and analysis of {\\\\it sparse-graph codes}, such as Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, which represent the state-of-the-art of modern packet communications. More significantly, we show how this design perspective leads to exciting, and to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored intellectual connections between learning and coding. The key is to relax the worst-case assumption with an ensemble-average setting, where the polynomial is assumed to be drawn uniformly at random from the ensemble of all polynomials (of a given size $n$ and sparsity $s$). Our framework succeeds with high probability with respect to the polynomial ensemble with sparsity up to $s={O}(2^{\\\\delta n})$ for any $\\\\delta\\\\in(0,1)$, where $f$ is exactly learned using ${O}(ns)$ queries in time ${O}(n s \\\\log s)$, even if the queries are perturbed by Gaussian noise. We further apply the proposed framework to graph sketching, which is the problem of inferring sparse graphs by querying graph cuts. By writing the cut function as a polynomial and exploiting the graph structure, we propose a sketching algorithm to learn the an arbitrary $n$-node unknown graph using only few cut queries, which scales {\\\\it almost linearly} in the number of edges and {\\\\it sub-linearly} in the graph size $n$.

When the probability distribution P(X,Y) is known, the optimal classifier, leading to the minimum misclassification rate, is given by the Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) decision rule. However, in practice, estimating the complete joint distribution P(X,Y) is computationally and statistically impossible for large values of d. Therefore, an alternative approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of the joint probability distribution P(X,Y) and then design the classifier based on the estimated low order marginals. This approach is also helpful when the complete training data instances are not available due to privacy concerns. In this work, we consider the problem of designing the optimum classifier based on some estimated low order marginals of (X,Y). We prove that for a given set of marginals, the minimum Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\\u00b4enyi (HGR) correlation principle introduced in [1] leads to a randomized classification rule which is shown to have a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate of the optimal classifier. Then, we show that under a separability condition, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a randomized linear regression approach which naturally results in a robust feature selection method selecting a subset of features having the maximum worst case HGR correlation with the target variable. Our theoretical upper-bound is similar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while the proposed algorithm has significant computational advantages since it only requires solving a least square optimization problem. Finally, we numerically compare our proposed algorithm with the DCC classifier and show that the proposed algorithm results in better misclassification rate over various UCI data repository datasets.</div>"

The rules are based on duality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero. This allows to discard safely more variables, in particular for low regularization parameters. The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance on coordinate descent for multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe rules.</div>"

This generality and simplicity in part explains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which updates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models.  However, the likelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global convergence guarantees.  Recently, method of moments approaches offer global guarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range of mixture models that exist.  In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying framework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily derivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single mixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is that the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which allows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem.  We solve its relaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using ideas from computer algebra.  This framework allows us to draw insights and apply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of moments to study problems in statistical estimation.

However, the choice of optimal embedding and an efficient algorithm to compute the same remains open. In this paper, we show that orthonormal representations, a class of unit-sphere graph embeddings are PAC learnable. Existing PAC-based analysis do not  apply as the VC dimension of the function class is infinite. We propose an alternative PAC-based bound, which do not depend on the VC dimension of the underlying function class, but is related to the famous Lov\\\\&apos;{a}sz~$\\\\vartheta$ function. The main contribution of the paper is SPORE, a SPectral regularized ORthonormal Embedding for graph transduction, derived from the PAC bound. SPORE is posed as a non-smooth convex function over an \\\\emph{elliptope}. These problems are usually solved as semi-definite programs (SDPs) with time complexity $O(n^6)$.  We present,  Infeasible Inexact proximal~(IIP): an Inexact proximal method which performs subgradient procedure on an approximate projection, not necessarily feasible. IIP is more scalable than SDP, has an $O(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{T}})$ convergence, and is generally applicable whenever a suitable approximate projection is available. We use IIP to compute SPORE where the approximate projection step is computed by FISTA, an accelerated gradient descent procedure. We show that the method has a convergence rate of $O(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{T}})$. The proposed algorithm easily scales to 1000&apos;s of vertices, while the standard SDP computation does not scale beyond few hundred vertices.

This is obtained via a variant of squared length sampling that we adapt to the kernel setting.

We address precisely this setting through a unified treatment using regularization. While regularization for high-dimensional problems is by now well understood, the iterative EM algorithm requires a careful balancing of making progress towards the solution while identifying the right structure (e.g., sparsity or low-rank).

Moreover, our design of moments (or ``pseudo-expectations&apos;&apos;) for this lower bound is quite different than previous lower bounds.

However, solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems remains a big challenge. Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is an excellent method for convex programming. However, it is still unknown whether the usual APG can ensure the convergence to a critical point in nonconvex programming. To address this issue, we introduce a monitor-corrector step and extend APG for general nonconvex and nonsmooth programs. Accordingly, we propose a monotone APG and a non-monotone APG. The latter waives the requirement on monotonic reduction of the objective function and needs less computation in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide APG-type algorithms for general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that every accumulation point is a critical point, and the convergence rates remain $O(1/k^2)$ when the problems are convex, in which k is the number of iterations.

Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least $\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{T})$ times over $T$ rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit eXploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework.Finally, we conduct a simple experiment that illustrates the robustness of our implicit exploration technique.</div>"

After ~O(1/epsilon) iterations, it gives a low-rank approximation within (1+epsilon) of optimal for spectral norm error.We give the first provable runtime improvement on Simultaneous Iteration: a randomized block Krylov method, closely related to the classic Block Lanczos algorithm, gives the same guarantees in just ~O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) iterations and performs substantially better experimentally. Our analysis is the first of a Krylov subspace method that does not depend on singular value gaps, which are unreliable in practice.Furthermore, while it is a simple accuracy benchmark, even (1+epsilon) error for spectral norm low-rank approximation does not imply that an algorithm returns high quality principal components, a major issue for data applications.

However, when LP shows an integrality gap, no model has been known which can be solved systematically via sequential applications of BP.

Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some \\\\emph{cutoff frequency}); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly.  Suppose we have $k$ point sources in $d$ dimensions, where the points are separated by at least $\\\\Delta$ from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees:1. The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by $O(1/\\\\Delta)$ (up to log factors). Previous algorithms require a \\\\emph{cutoff frequency}  which may be as large as  $\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{d}/\\\\Delta)$.2. The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points $k$ and the dimension $d$, with \\\\emph{no} dependence on the separation $\\\\Delta$.

Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., $g_i(x)=sign(x+z_i)$, corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate $x_0$ via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., $\\\\hat x=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x}\\\\|y-Ax_0\\\\|_2+\\\\lambda f(x)$ for some regularization parameter $\\\\lambda &gt;0$ and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer $f$ that promotes the structure of $x_0$, e.g. $\\\\ell_1$-norm, nuclear-norm. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function $g$, both Brillinger and Plan and Vershynin have shown that, when the entries of $A$ are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of $x_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\\\\mu$, which only depends on $g$. In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions for $\\\\|\\\\hat x-\\\\mu x_0\\\\|_2$, for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when $m$ and $n$ grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear $y_i=\\\\mu a_i^Tx_0+\\\\sigma z_i$, with $\\\\mu=E[\\\\gamma g(\\\\gamma)]$ and $\\\\sigma^2=E[(g(\\\\gamma)-\\\\mu\\\\gamma)^2]$, and, $\\\\gamma$ standard normal. The derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer.</div>"

While these methods show good versatility, they are computationally intensive and have poor scalability to large data as they require operations on Gram matrices. In order to mitigate this serious computational limitation, recently randomized constructions have been proposed in the literature, which allow the application of fast linear algorithms. Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable, low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i) establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size) performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in L^r (1 \\u2264 r &lt; \\u221e) norms. We also propose an RFF approximation to derivatives of a kernel with a theoretical study on its approximation quality.</div>"

We prove that it is possible to solve unstructured quadratic systems in n variables exactly from O(n) equations in linear time, that is, in time proportional to reading and evaluating the data. This is accomplished by a novel procedure, which starting from an initial guess given by a spectral initialization procedure, attempts to minimize a non-convex objective. The proposed algorithm distinguishes from prior approaches by regularizing the initialization and descent procedures in an adaptive fashion, which discard terms bearing too much influence on the initial estimate or search directions. These careful selection rules---which effectively serve as a variance reduction scheme---provide a tighter initial guess, more robust descent directions, and thus enhanced practical performance. Further, this procedure also achieves a near-optimal statistical accuracy in the presence of noise. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the computational cost of our algorithm is about four times that of solving a least-squares problem of the same size.</div>"

However, beyond optimization, these notions allow specifying expressive probabilistic models that can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty via marginal inference. Prominent, well-studied special cases include Ising models and determinantal point processes, but the general class of log-submodular and log-supermodular models is much richer and little studied. In this paper, we investigate the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference in general log-submodular and log-supermodular models. In particular, we consider a simple Gibbs sampling procedure, and establish two sufficient conditions, the first guaranteeing polynomial-time, and the second fast (O(nlogn)) mixing.

This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the U-statistic of interest.

Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces.

We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models.

EP approximates the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local-approximations that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer analytic and computational advantages over other approximations, such as Variational Inference (VI), and is the method of choice for a number of models. The local nature of EP appears to make it an ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on large models in large-scale datasets settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in this context: the number approximating factors needs to increase with the number of data-points, N, which often entails a prohibitively large memory overhead. This paper presents an extension to EP, called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP), that maintains a global posterior approximation (like VI) but updates it in a local way (like EP).  Experiments on a number of canonical learning problems using synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor of N. SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning in the large model, large dataset setting.</div>"

A new algorithm is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm accelerates the training of deep architectures compared to DOWNPOUR and other common baseline approaches and furthermore is very communication efficient.</div>"

For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all symbols appearing the same number of times.Specifically, for distributions over $k$ symbols and $n$ samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of $(3+o(1))/n^{1/3}$ from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\min(k/n,1/\\\\sqrt n))$.

These techniques have been well used to capture neural correlations across a population and to provide a smooth, denoised, and concise representation of high-dimensional spiking data.  One limitation of many current models is that the observation model is assumed to be Poisson, which lacks the flexibility to capture under- and over-dispersion that is common in recorded neural data, thereby introducing bias into estimates of covariance.  Here we develop the generalized count linear dynamical system, which relaxes the Poisson assumption by using a more general exponential family for count data.  In addition to containing Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial, and other common count distributions as special cases, we show that this model can be tractably learned by extending recent advances in variational inference techniques.

Our model assumes that each label vector is generated as a weighted combination of a set of topics (each topic being a distribution over labels), where the combination weights (i.e., the embeddings) for each label vector are conditioned on the observed feature vector. This construction, coupled with a Bernoulli-Poisson link function for each label of the binary label vector, leads to a model with a computational cost that scales in the number of positive labels in the label matrix. This makes the model particularly appealing for real-world multi-label learning problems where the label matrix is usually very massive but highly sparse. Using a data-augmentation strategy leads to full local conjugacy in our model, facilitating simple and very efficient Gibbs sampling, as well as an Expectation Maximization algorithm for inference. Also, predicting the label vector at test time does not require doing an inference for the label embeddings and can be done in closed form. We report results on several benchmark data sets, comparing our model with various state-of-the art methods.</div>"

Experimental evidence of a \\&quot;Bayesian brain\\&quot; has been steadily growing, as has the collection of models that have been put forward as possible candidates for a neuronal implementation of Bayesian inference.\\r\\nThe study of generative and discriminative models for various types of data is further bolstered by advances in fields that lie outside of neuroscience, but have obvious conceptual connections, such as machine learning and AI. Recent theoretical studies point towards a link between these models and biological neural networks.\\r\\nWhether biological or not, all of these models are only as efficient as the physical substrate that they are embedded in allows them to be. Power efficiency as well as execution speed are of increasing importance as both the network models and their associated learning algorithms become large and/or complex. In our demo session, we will show the first implementation of neural sampling in mixed-signal, low-power and highly accelerated neuromorphic hardware. We will discuss the network structure and mechanisms by which we were able to counteract the imperfections that are inherent to the hardware manufacturing process and provide an interactive interface for users to manipulate the emulation parameters, in particular those of the target probability distribution from which the neuromorphic chip samples. The corresponding parameters of the on-chip spiking neural network can then either be calculated analytically or trained with simple learning rules. More advanced users which are familiar with spiking network simulators will be able to make use of the full versatility of the hardware substrate and program their own network models for neuromorphic emulation. </div>"

We found this property prevents the deep learning approaches from outperforming the state-of-the-art if the task itself requires translation variant interpolation (TVI). In this paper, we draw on Shepard interpolation and design Shepard Convolutional Neural Networks (ShCNN) which efficiently realizes end-to-end trainable TVI operators in the network. We show that by adding only a few feature maps in the new Shepard layers, the network is able to achieve stronger results than a much deeper architecture.

In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output representations using stochastic inference.

Single-Image SR deals with each video frame independently, and ignores intrinsic temporal dependency of video frames which actually plays a very important role in video super-resolution. Multi-Frame SR generally extracts motion information, e.g. optical flow, to model the temporal dependency, which often shows high computational cost. Considering that recurrent neural network (RNN) can model long-term contextual information of temporal sequences well, we propose a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for efficient multi-frame SR.Different from vanilla RNN, 1) the commonly-used recurrent full connections are replaced with weight-sharing convolutional connections and 2) conditional convolutional connections from previous input layers to current hidden layer are added for enhancing visual-temporal dependency modelling. With the powerful temporal dependency modelling, our model can super resolve videos with complex motions and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Our experiments aresurprising, and suggest that classifiers from the human visual system can betransferred into a machine with some success. Since these classifiers seem tocapture favorable biases in the human visual system, we further present an SVMformulation that constrains the orientation of the SVM hyperplane to agree withthe bias from human visual system.

To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9\\u00d7, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss.

The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy.

This model synthesizes random dynamic textures which are defined by stationary Gaussian distributions obtained by the random aggregation of warped patterns. Importantly, we show that this model can equivalently be described as a stochastic partial differential equation. Using this characterization of motion in images, it allows us to recast motion-energy models into a principled Bayesian inference framework.

Our model assumes that each label vector is generated as a weighted combination of a set of topics (each topic being a distribution over labels), where the combination weights (i.e., the embeddings) for each label vector are conditioned on the observed feature vector. This construction, coupled with a Bernoulli-Poisson link function for each label of the binary label vector, leads to a model with a computational cost that scales in the number of positive labels in the label matrix. This makes the model particularly appealing for real-world multi-label learning problems where the label matrix is usually very massive but highly sparse. Using a data-augmentation strategy leads to full local conjugacy in our model, facilitating simple and very efficient Gibbs sampling, as well as an Expectation Maximization algorithm for inference. Also, predicting the label vector at test time does not require doing an inference for the label embeddings and can be done in closed form.

We demonstrate that our algorithm provides performance equal to, and sometimes superior to, persistent contrastive divergence, while also providing a clear and easy to evaluate objective function.

However, for perceptual decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the brain indeed uses the reliability for making decisions when confronted with unpredictable changes in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic drift diffusion model, which has frequently been used to explain experimental findings in perceptual decision making, implicitly relies on estimates of stimulus reliability. We then show that only those variants of the drift diffusion model which allow stimulus-specific reliabilities are consistent with neurophysiological findings.

With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension of message estimators is the same as the number of classes, rather than exponentially growing in the order of the potentials.

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Latent factor models have been widely used to analyze simultaneous recordings of spike trains from large, heterogeneous neural populations.  These models assume  the signal of interest in the population is a low-dimensional latent intensity that evolves over time, which is observed in high dimension via noisy point-process observations.  These techniques have been well used to capture neural correlations across a population and to provide a smooth, denoised, and concise representation of high-dimensional spiking data.  One limitation of many current models is that the observation model is assumed to be Poisson, which lacks the flexibility to capture under- and over-dispersion that is common in recorded neural data, thereby introducing bias into estimates of covariance.  Here we develop the generalized count linear dynamical system, which relaxes the Poisson assumption by using a more general exponential family for count data.  In addition to containing Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial, and other common count distributions as special cases, we show that this model can be tractably learned by extending recent advances in variational inference techniques.  We apply our model to data from primate motor cortex and demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, both in capturing the variance structure of the data and in held-out prediction.</div>"

However, the lack of an efficient parameter learning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or requires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we present the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning methods for CT-HMM models. We demonstrate that the learning problem consists of two challenges: the estimation of posterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned statistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation problem in terms of an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The second challenge is addressed by adapting three approaches from the continuous time Markov chain literature to the CT-HMM domain. We demonstrate the use of CT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression using a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer&apos;s disease dataset.</div>"

One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold.  There are a rich variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data points to the manifold.  However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the observed data.  The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance.  We solve these issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions among particles.  Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process.  Focusing on the simple case of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including filling in missing frames in video.</div>"

The generative model can be equivalently considered in the frequency domain, where the power spectral density of the signal is specified using a Gaussian process. One of the main contributions of the paper is to develop a novel variational free-energy approach based on inter-domain inducing variables that efficiently learns the continuous-time linear filter and infers the driving white-noise process. In turn, this scheme provides closed-form probabilistic estimates of the covariance kernel and the noise-free signal both in denoising and prediction scenarios. Additionally, the variational inference procedure provides closed-form expressions for the approximate posterior of the spectral density given the observed data, leading to new Bayesian nonparametric  approaches to spectrum estimation.

EP approximates the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local-approximations that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer analytic and computational advantages over other approximations, such as Variational Inference (VI), and is the method of choice for a number of models. The local nature of EP appears to make it an ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on large models in large-scale datasets settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in this context: the number approximating factors needs to increase with the number of data-points, N, which often entails a prohibitively large memory overhead. This paper presents an extension to EP, called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP), that maintains a global posterior approximation (like VI) but updates it in a local way (like EP).  Experiments on a number of canonical learning problems using synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor of N. SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning in the large model, large dataset setting.</div>"

A new algorithm is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.

However, MCMC often suffers from slow convergence when the acceptance rate is low. Tree-based inference is an alternative deterministic posterior inference method, where Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) or incremental Bayesian hierarchical clustering (IBHC) have been developed for DP or NRM mixture (NRMM) models, respectively. Although IBHC is a promising method for posterior inference for NRMM models due to its efficiency and applicability to online inference, its convergence is not guaranteed since it uses heuristics that simply selects the best solution after multiple trials are made. In this paper, we present a hybrid inference algorithm for NRMM models, which combines the merits of both MCMC and IBHC. Trees built by IBHC outlinespartitions of data, which guides Metropolis-Hastings procedure to employ appropriate proposals.

However, it has difficulty simulating Hamiltonian dynamics with non-smooth functions, leading to poor performance. This paper is motivated by the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in physical systems like optics. We introduce a modification of the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics on piecewise continuous energies, where intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities are detected, and the momentum is reflected or refracted to compensate for the change in energy. We prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine. Experiments show that by reducing the number of rejected samples, this method improves on traditional HMC.</div>"

DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exactsampling or analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters ofkernel $K$ through likelihood-based inference is notstraightforward. First, the kernel that appears in thelikelihood is not $K$, but another kernel $L$ related to $K$ throughan often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is typically bypassed in machine learning bydirectly parametrizing the kernel $L$, at the price of someinterpretability of the model parameters. We follow this approachhere. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizingconstant, which takes the form of large determinant in the case of aDPP over a finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in thecase of a DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on the likelihood ofa DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike previous work, our bounds arecheap to evaluate since they do not rely on approximating the spectrumof a large matrix or an operator. Through usual arguments, these bounds thus yield cheap variationalinference and moderately expensive exact Markov chain Monte Carlo inference methods for DPPs.</div>"

Building on intuition from geometric convexity, we propose a simple reformulation that has remarkable consequences: it makes Riemannian optimization not only match EM (a nontrivial result on its own, given the poor record nonlinear programming has had against EM), but also outperform it in many settings.

When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss. We propose top-k multiclass SVM as a direct method to optimize for top-k performance. Our generalization of the well-known multiclass SVM is based on a tight convex upper bound of the top-k error. We propose a fast optimization scheme based on an efficient projection onto the top-k simplex, which is of its own interest.

The reasoning is sound: a reduction in variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced.  However, the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection, since standard measures of sample quality like effective sample size do not account for asymptotic bias.  To address these challenges, we introduce a new computable quality measure based on Stein&apos;s method that bounds the discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test functions.  We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample sequences and illustrate applications to hyperparameter selection, convergence rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior inference.</div>"

We prove that it is possible to solve unstructured quadratic systems in n variables exactly from O(n) equations in linear time, that is, in time proportional to reading and evaluating the data. This is accomplished by a novel procedure, which starting from an initial guess given by a spectral initialization procedure, attempts to minimize a non-convex objective. The proposed algorithm distinguishes from prior approaches by regularizing the initialization and descent procedures in an adaptive fashion, which discard terms bearing too much influence on the initial estimate or search directions. These careful selection rules---which effectively serve as a variance reduction scheme---provide a tighter initial guess, more robust descent directions, and thus enhanced practical performance. Further, this procedure also achieves a near-optimal statistical accuracy in the presence of noise. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the computational cost of our algorithm is about four times that of solving a least-squares problem of the same size.</div>"

Prominent, well-studied special cases include Ising models and determinantal point processes, but the general class of log-submodular and log-supermodular models is much richer and little studied. In this paper, we investigate the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference in general log-submodular and log-supermodular models. In particular, we consider a simple Gibbs sampling procedure, and establish two sufficient conditions, the first guaranteeing polynomial-time, and the second fast (O(nlogn)) mixing.

We bridge this gap by presentinga unifying framework that captures many variance reduction techniques.Subsequently, we propose an asynchronous algorithm grounded in our framework,with fast convergence rates. An important consequence of our general approachis that it yields asynchronous versions of variance reduction algorithms such asSVRG, SAGA as a byproduct. Our method achieves near linear speedup in sparsesettings common to machine learning. We demonstrate the empirical performanceof our method through a concrete realization of asynchronous SVRG.</div>"

It has been shown that BP can solve a number of combinatorial optimization problems including minimum weight matching, shortest path, network flow and vertex cover under the following common assumption: the respective Linear Programming (LP) relaxation is tight, i.e.,  no integrality gap is present.  However, when LP shows an integrality gap, no model has been known which can be solved systematically via sequential applications of BP. In this paper, we develop the first such algorithm, coined Blossom-BP, for solving the minimum weight matching problem over arbitrary graphs. Each step of the sequential algorithm requires applying BP over a modified graph constructed by contractions and expansions of blossoms, i.e., odd sets of vertices. Our scheme guarantees termination in O(n^2) of BP runs, where n is the number of vertices in the original graph.

Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., $g_i(x)=sign(x+z_i)$, corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate $x_0$ via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., $\\\\hat x=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x}\\\\|y-Ax_0\\\\|_2+\\\\lambda f(x)$ for some regularization parameter $\\\\lambda &gt;0$ and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer $f$ that promotes the structure of $x_0$, e.g. $\\\\ell_1$-norm, nuclear-norm.

In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions for $\\\\|\\\\hat x-\\\\mu x_0\\\\|_2$, for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when $m$ and $n$ grow large.

After ~O(1/epsilon) iterations, it gives a low-rank approximation within (1+epsilon) of optimal for spectral norm error.We give the first provable runtime improvement on Simultaneous Iteration: a randomized block Krylov method, closely related to the classic Block Lanczos algorithm, gives the same guarantees in just ~O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) iterations and performs substantially better experimentally. Our analysis is the first of a Krylov subspace method that does not depend on singular value gaps, which are unreliable in practice.Furthermore, while it is a simple accuracy benchmark, even (1+epsilon) error for spectral norm low-rank approximation does not imply that an algorithm returns high quality principal components, a major issue for data applications. We address this problem for the first time by showing that both Block Krylov Iteration and Simultaneous Iteration give nearly optimal PCA for any matrix.

For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all symbols appearing the same number of times.Specifically, for distributions over $k$ symbols and $n$ samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of $(3+o(1))/n^{1/3}$ from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\min(k/n,1/\\\\sqrt n))$.

However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee).

This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some \\\\emph{cutoff frequency}); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly.  Suppose we have $k$ point sources in $d$ dimensions, where the points are separated by at least $\\\\Delta$ from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees:1. The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by $O(1/\\\\Delta)$ (up to log factors). Previous algorithms require a \\\\emph{cutoff frequency}  which may be as large as  $\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{d}/\\\\Delta)$.2. The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points $k$ and the dimension $d$, with \\\\emph{no} dependence on the separation $\\\\Delta$. In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse polynomially  on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for both of these quantities.Our estimation procedure itself is simple: we take random bandlimited measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the hyper-grid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on concentration bounds of sampling and singular value decomposition).</div>"

While these methods show good versatility, they are computationally intensive and have poor scalability to large data as they require operations on Gram matrices. In order to mitigate this serious computational limitation, recently randomized constructions have been proposed in the literature, which allow the application of fast linear algorithms. Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable, low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i) establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size) performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in L^r (1 \\u2264 r &lt; \\u221e) norms.

The time complexity is significantly better than both spectral and SDP-based approaches.The main contribution of the algorithm is in the case of unequal sizes in the bipartition that arises in our reduction from the planted CSP.

It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. However, with extremely large feature dimensions, solving TGL remains a significant challenge due to its highly complicated regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response. Thus, we can remove the detected nodes from the optimization without sacrificing accuracy. The major challenge in developing such testing rules is due to the overlaps between the parents and their children nodes. By a novel hierarchical projection algorithm, MLFre is able to test the nodes independently from any of their ancestor nodes. Moreover, we can integrate MLFre---that has a low computational cost---with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the speedup gained by MLFre can be orders of magnitude.</div>"

We then show that a large family of first-order accelerated methods can be obtained as a discretization of the ODE, and these methods converge at a $O(1/k^2)$ rate.

Solving this problem requires both accurately recognizing a visual relationship and generating a transformed query image accordingly.

Despite the importance of this topic, this problem has only been studied in limited scenarios within the computer vision community.  In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based approach for gaze-following and a new benchmark dataset for thorough evaluation. Given an image and the location of a head, our approach follows the gaze of the person and identifies the object being looked at. After training, the network is able to discover how to extract head pose and gaze orientation, and to select objects in the scene that are in the predicted line of sight and likely to be looked at (such as televisions, balls and food). The quantitative evaluation shows that our approach produces reliable results, even when viewing only the back of the head.

Such approaches have been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an approach based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs a class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs the likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score. We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during training.

While the mechanism for rapid path planning is unknown, the CA3 region in the hippocampus plays an important role, and emerging evidence suggests that place cell activity during hippocampal \\&quot;preplay\\&quot; periods may trace out future goal-directed trajectories. Here, we show how a particular mapping of space allows for the immediate generation of trajectories between arbitrary start and goal locations in an environment, based only on the mapped representation of the goal. We show that this representation can be implemented in a neural attractor network model, resulting in bump--like activity profiles resembling those of the CA3 region of hippocampus. Neurons tend to locally excite neurons with similar place field centers, while inhibiting other neurons with distant place field centers, such that stable bumps of activity can form at arbitrary locations in the environment. The network is initialized to represent a point in the environment, then weakly stimulated with an input corresponding to an arbitrary goal location. We show that the resulting activity can be interpreted as a gradient ascent on the value function induced by a reward at the goal location. Indeed, in networks with large place fields, we show that the network properties cause the bump to move smoothly from its initial location to the goal, around obstacles or walls. Our results illustrate that an attractor network with hippocampal-like attributes may be important for rapid path planning.</div>"

In this architecture, labels associated with an image are identified by classification network, and binary segmentation is subsequently performed for each identified label by segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately based on the training data with image-level and pixel-wise class labels, respectively. It facilitates to reduce search space for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers. Our algorithm shows outstanding performance compared to other semi-supervised approaches even with much less training images with strong annotations in PASCAL VOC dataset. </div>"

We propose and evaluate two deep neural network architectures that consist of encoding, action-conditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures are able to generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games.

For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets.  For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses.  Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of $64$), we achieve $99.42\\\\%$ accuracy at $121 \\\\mu$J per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of $1$) we achieve $92.7\\\\%$ accuracy at $0.408 \\\\mu$J per image.</div>"

In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant estimation method that is built around a \\&quot;classifier\\&quot; for identifying the true chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color channels). During inference, each pixel&apos;s observed color restricts its true chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth reflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier \\&quot;end-to-end\\&quot;. Using stochastic gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error distribution.</div>"

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200,000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive $O(Dd)$ computational cost for each example, as does updating the $D \\\\times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, this case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach that, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in $O(d^2)$  per example instead of $O(Dd)$, remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output.

Perhaps inspired by the many advantages of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under such curves for accuracy-based performance assessment, many researchers have taken to report Precision-Recall (PR) curves and associated areas as performance metric. We demonstrate in this paper that this practice is fraught with difficulties, mainly because of incoherent scale assumptions -- e.g., the area under a PR curve takes the arithmetic mean of precision values whereas the $F_{\\\\beta}$ score applies the harmonic mean. We show how to fix this by plotting PR curves in a different coordinate system, and demonstrate that the new Precision-Recall-Gain curves inherit all key advantages of ROC curves. In particular, the area under Precision-Recall-Gain curves conveys an expected $F_1$ score on a harmonic scale, and the convex hull of a Precision-Recall-Gain curve allows us to calibrate the classifier&apos;s scores so as to determine, for each operating point on the convex hull, the interval of $\\\\beta$ values for which the point optimises $F_{\\\\beta}$. We demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR curves can easily favour models with lower expected $F_1$ score than others, and so the use of Precision-Recall-Gain curves will result in better model selection. </div>"

Following eye gaze, or gaze-following, is an important ability that allows us to understand what other people are thinking, the actions they are performing, and even predict what they might do next. Despite the importance of this topic, this problem has only been studied in limited scenarios within the computer vision community.  In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based approach for gaze-following and a new benchmark dataset for thorough evaluation. Given an image and the location of a head, our approach follows the gaze of the person and identifies the object being looked at. After training, the network is able to discover how to extract head pose and gaze orientation, and to select objects in the scene that are in the predicted line of sight and likely to be looked at (such as televisions, balls and food). The quantitative evaluation shows that our approach produces reliable results, even when viewing only the back of the head. While our method outperforms several baseline approaches, we are still far from reaching human performance at this task. Overall, we believe that this is a challenging and important task that deserves more attention from the community. </div>"

The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering and to language modeling.

Such approaches have been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an approach based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs a class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs the likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score. We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during training.

While the mechanism for rapid path planning is unknown, the CA3 region in the hippocampus plays an important role, and emerging evidence suggests that place cell activity during hippocampal \\&quot;preplay\\&quot; periods may trace out future goal-directed trajectories. Here, we show how a particular mapping of space allows for the immediate generation of trajectories between arbitrary start and goal locations in an environment, based only on the mapped representation of the goal. We show that this representation can be implemented in a neural attractor network model, resulting in bump--like activity profiles resembling those of the CA3 region of hippocampus. Neurons tend to locally excite neurons with similar place field centers, while inhibiting other neurons with distant place field centers, such that stable bumps of activity can form at arbitrary locations in the environment. The network is initialized to represent a point in the environment, then weakly stimulated with an input corresponding to an arbitrary goal location. We show that the resulting activity can be interpreted as a gradient ascent on the value function induced by a reward at the goal location. Indeed, in networks with large place fields, we show that the network properties cause the bump to move smoothly from its initial location to the goal, around obstacles or walls. Our results illustrate that an attractor network with hippocampal-like attributes may be important for rapid path planning.</div>"

Successful approaches include both generative models of natural images as well as discriminative training of deep neural networks. Discriminative training of feed forward architectures allows explicit control over the computational cost of performing restoration and therefore often leads to better performance at the same cost at run time.  In contrast, generative models have the advantage that they can be trained once and then adapted to any image restoration task by a simple use of Bayes&apos; rule. In this paper we show how to combine the strengths of both approaches by training a discriminative, feed-forward architecture to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images. We apply this idea to the very successful Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of natural images. We show that it is possible to achieve comparable performance as the original GMM but with two orders of magnitude improvement in run time while maintaining the advantage of generative models.</div>"

For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets.  For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses.  Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of $64$), we achieve $99.42\\\\%$ accuracy at $121 \\\\mu$J per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of $1$) we achieve $92.7\\\\%$ accuracy at $0.408 \\\\mu$J per image.</div>"

Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients.

In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant estimation method that is built around a \\&quot;classifier\\&quot; for identifying the true chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color channels). During inference, each pixel&apos;s observed color restricts its true chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth reflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier \\&quot;end-to-end\\&quot;. Using stochastic gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error distribution.</div>"

In this work we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of auto-sklearn.</div>"

Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive $O(Dd)$ computational cost for each example, as does updating the $D \\\\times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers.

Perhaps inspired by the many advantages of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under such curves for accuracy-based performance assessment, many researchers have taken to report Precision-Recall (PR) curves and associated areas as performance metric. We demonstrate in this paper that this practice is fraught with difficulties, mainly because of incoherent scale assumptions -- e.g., the area under a PR curve takes the arithmetic mean of precision values whereas the $F_{\\\\beta}$ score applies the harmonic mean. We show how to fix this by plotting PR curves in a different coordinate system, and demonstrate that the new Precision-Recall-Gain curves inherit all key advantages of ROC curves. In particular, the area under Precision-Recall-Gain curves conveys an expected $F_1$ score on a harmonic scale, and the convex hull of a Precision-Recall-Gain curve allows us to calibrate the classifier&apos;s scores so as to determine, for each operating point on the convex hull, the interval of $\\\\beta$ values for which the point optimises $F_{\\\\beta}$. We demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR curves can easily favour models with lower expected $F_1$ score than others, and so the use of Precision-Recall-Gain curves will result in better model selection. </div>"

Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in sup- port of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs.</div>"

In the proposed framework, processing nodes receive a sequence of data minibatches, compute a variational posterior for each, and make asynchronous streaming updates to a central model. In contrast to previous algorithms, the proposed framework is truly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and truncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their components, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP posterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper develops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences, and provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an application of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance.</div>"

Solving our generalized IRL problem thus involves not only learning these reward functions but also the stochastic transitions between them at any state (including unvisited states).

As a result, the most likely partition of a trajectory into segments that are generated from different locally consistent reward functions selected by EM can be derived.

In particular, we show that for multilabel metrics constructed as instance-, micro- and macro-averages, the population optimal classifier can be decomposed into binary classifiers based on the marginal instance-conditional distribution of each label, with a weak association between labels via the threshold. Thus, our analysis extends the state of the art from a few known multilabel classification metrics such as Hamming loss, to a general framework applicable to many of the classification metrics in common use.

Because such analysis begins with dimensionality reduction, modelling early sensory processing requires biologically plausible online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory inputs is variable there is a need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here, we derive biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input covariance matrix. We formulate three objective functions which, in the offline setting, are optimized by the projections of the input dataset onto its principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix. In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded, ii) hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding adaptive algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in networks with biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the last two networks, neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits.</div>"

Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the large datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed consensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel (Scott et al, 2013). A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding approximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The resulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a relaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise concave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior quality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured against serial MCMC) of up to 39% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations; similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92% on the task of estimating cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8 components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost compared to the runtime of serial MCMC, achieving near-ideal speedup in some instances.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is non-trivial.  Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise.  In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers--including stochastic gradient versions--based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices.  We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework.  We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially \\&quot;reinvented\\&quot; in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC).  Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.</div>"

We consider the problem of partitioning the set of items into a given number of parts such that the maximum number of topics covered by a part of the partition is minimized. This is a natural clustering problem, with various applications, e.g. partitioning of a set of  information objects such as documents, images, and videos, and load balancing in the context of computation platforms.In this paper, we focus on the streaming computation model for this problem, in which items arrive online one at a time and each item must be assigned irrevocably to a part of the partition at its arrival time. Motivated by scalability requirements, we focus on the class of streaming computation algorithms with memory limited to be at most linear in the number of the parts of the partition. We show that a greedy assignment strategy is able to recover a hidden co-clustering of items under a natural set of recovery conditions.

As the output kernel is a positive semidefinite matrix, the resulting optimization problems are not scalable in the  number of tasks as an eigendecomposition is required in each step. Using the theory of positive semidefinite kernels we show in this paper that for a certain class of regularizers on the output kernel, the constraint of being positive semidefinite can be dropped as it is automatically satisfied for the relaxed problem. This leads to an unconstrained dual problem which can be solved efficiently.

Markov random fields (MRFs) are a complementary model of symmetric relationships used in computer vision, spatial modeling, and social and gene expression networks.  A chain graph model under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation (hereafter a chain graph model) generalizes both Bayesian networks and MRFs, and can represent asymmetric and symmetric relationships together.As in other graphical models, the set of marginals from distributions in a chain graph model induced by the presence of hidden variables forms a complex model.  One recent approach to the study of marginal graphical models is to consider a well-behaved supermodel.  Such a supermodel of marginals of Bayesian networks, defined only by conditional independences, and termed the ordinary Markov model, was studied at length in (Evans and Richardson, 2014).In this paper, we show that special mixed graphs which we call segregated graphs can be associated, via a Markov property, with supermodels of a marginal of chain graphs defined only by conditional independences.  Special features of segregated graphs imply the existence of a very natural factorization for these supermodels, and imply many existing results on the chain graph model, and ordinary Markov model carry over.  Our results suggest that segregated graphs define an analogue of the ordinary Markov model for marginals of chain graph models.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Tree structured group Lasso (TGL) is a powerful technique in uncovering the tree structured sparsity over the features, where each node encodes a group of features. It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. However, with extremely large feature dimensions, solving TGL remains a significant challenge due to its highly complicated regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response. Thus, we can remove the detected nodes from the optimization without sacrificing accuracy. The major challenge in developing such testing rules is due to the overlaps between the parents and their children nodes. By a novel hierarchical projection algorithm, MLFre is able to test the nodes independently from any of their ancestor nodes. Moreover, we can integrate MLFre---that has a low computational cost---with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the speedup gained by MLFre can be orders of magnitude.</div>"

This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in Abbe-Sandon &apos;15. In the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and achieves the optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees. This lower-bound requirement is removed for the regime of diverging degrees. For the logarithmic degree regime, this is further enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that simultaneously learns the model parameters, achieves the optimal CH-limit for exact recovery, and runs in quasi-linear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the SBM.</div>"

One way to overcome this is to restrict parameters to a tractable set, most typically the set of tree-structured parameters. This paper explores an alternative notion of a tractable set, namely a set of \\u201cfast-mixing parameters\\u201d where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution. While it is common in practice to approximate the likelihood gradient using samples obtained from MCMC, such procedures lack theoretical guarantees. This paper proves that for any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, (not just graphical models) when parameters are constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set with high-probability. When unregularized, to find a solution epsilon-accurate in log-likelihood requires a total amount of effort cubic in 1/epsilon, disregarding logarithmic factors. When ridge-regularized, strong convexity allows a solution epsilon-accurate in parameter distance with an effort quadratic in 1/epsilon. Both of these provide of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme.</div>"

The objective is to minimize the number of experiments to discover the causal directions of all the edges in a causal graph. Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case. In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics. We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized adaptive learning algorithms. For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number of interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new deterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton completely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an $\\\\alpha$-approximation algorithm where $\\\\alpha$ is the independence number of the graph.  We also show that there exist graph classes for which the sufficient number of experiments is close to the lower bound. In the other extreme, there are graph classes for which the required number of experiments is multiplicatively $\\\\alpha$ away from our lower bound. In simulations, our algorithm almost always performs very close to the lower bound, while the approach based on separating systems for complete graphs is significantly worse for random chordal graphs.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a workhorse in machine learning, yet it is also known to be slow relative to steepest descent.  Recently, variance reduction techniques such as SVRG and SAGA have been proposed to overcome this weakness. With asymptotically vanishing variance, a constant step size can be maintained, resulting in geometric convergence rates. However, these methods are either based on occasional computations of full gradients at pivot points (SVRG), or on keeping per data point corrections in memory (SAGA). This has the disadvantage that one cannot employ these methods in a streaming setting and that speed-ups relative to SGD may need a certain number of epochs in order to materialize. This paper investigates a new class of algorithms that can exploit neighborhood structure in the training data to share and re-use information about past stochastic gradients across data points.

We investigate this family of algorithms in a thorough analysis and show supporting experimental results.

The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent graph recovery.

Previous theoretical work has rigorously characterized label complexity of active learning, but most of this work has focused on the PAC or the agnostic PAC model. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting -- maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields. We provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extraround of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum likelihood estimation.  On the empirical side, the recent work in (Gu et al. 2012) and (Gu et al. 2014) (on active linear and logistic regression) shows the promise of this approach.</div>"

However, its convergence rate is known to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple less-known fix is to add the possibility to take `away steps&apos; during optimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility oracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that has been successfully applied in practice: FW with away steps, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe&apos;s minimum norm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global linear convergence under a weaker condition than strong convexity. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation as the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel geometric quantity that plays the role of the `condition number&apos; of the constraint set.

As a preselection method, it selects a moderate size subset of candidate variables for further refining via feature selection to produce the final model. The performance of variable screening depends on both computational efficiency and the ability to dramatically reduce the number of variables without discarding the important ones. When the data dimension $p$ is substantially larger than the sample size $n$, variable screening becomes crucial as 1) Faster feature selection algorithms are needed; 2) Conditions guaranteeing selection consistency might fail to hold.This article studies a class of linear screening methods and establishes consistency theory for this special class. In particular, we prove the restricted diagonally dominant (RDD) condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for strong screening consistency.

We then show that a large family of first-order accelerated methods can be obtained as a discretization of the ODE, and these methods converge at a $O(1/k^2)$ rate.

However, the objective function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure.

Side information has been considered in several matrix completion applications, and is generally shown to be useful empirically.  Recently, Xu et al. studied the effect of side information for matrix completion under a theoretical viewpoint, showing that sample complexity can be significantly reduced given completely clean features.  However, since in reality most given features are noisy or even weakly informative, how to develop a general model to handle general feature set, and how much the noisy features can help matrix recovery in theory, is still an important issue to investigate. In this paper, we propose a novel model that balances between features and observations simultaneously, enabling us to leverage feature information yet to be robust to feature noise.  Moreover, we study the effectof general features in theory, and show that by using our model, the sample complexity can still be lower than matrix completion as long as features are sufficiently informative. This result provides a theoretical insight of usefulness for general side information.  Finally, we consider synthetic data and two real applications - relationship prediction and semi-supervised clustering, showing that our model outperforms other methods for matrix completion with features both in theory and practice.</div>"

The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2008] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong l2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust.

Among the commonly used kernels for nonlinear classification are polynomial kernels, for which low approximation error has thus far necessitated explicit feature maps of large dimensionality, especially for higher-order polynomials. Meanwhile, because polynomial kernels are unbounded, they are frequently applied to data that has been normalized to unit l2 norm. The question we address in this work is: if we know a priori that data is so normalized, can we devise a more compact map? We show that a putative affirmative answer to this question based on Random Fourier Features is impossible in this setting, and introduce a new approximation paradigm, Spherical Random Fourier (SRF) features, which circumvents these issues and delivers a compact approximation to polynomial kernels for data on the unit sphere. Compared to prior work, SRF features are less rank-deficient, more compact, and achieve better kernel approximation, especially for higher-order polynomials.

However, it remainsunclear how such supervised learning is implemented in biological neural networks.Learning in recurrent spiking networks is notoriously difficult because localchanges in connectivity may have an unpredictable effect on the global dynamics.The most commonly used learning rules, such as temporal back-propagation,are not local and thus not biologically plausible. Furthermore, reproducing thePoisson-like statistics of neural responses requires the use of networks with balancedexcitation and inhibition. Such balance is easily destroyed during learning.Using a top-down approach, we show how networks of integrate-and-fire neuronscan learn arbitrary linear dynamical systems by feeding back their error asa feed-forward input. The network uses two types of recurrent connections: fastand slow. The fast connections learn to balance excitation and inhibition using avoltage-based plasticity rule. The slow connections are trained to minimize theerror feedback using a current-based Hebbian learning rule. Importantly, the balancemaintained by fast connections is crucial to ensure that global error signalsare available locally in each neuron, in turn resulting in a local learning rule forthe slow connections. This demonstrates that spiking networks can learn complexdynamics using purely local learning rules, using E/I balance as the key ratherthan an additional constraint. The resulting network implements a given functionwithin the predictive coding scheme, with minimal dimensions and activity.</div>"

This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence.  We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead.

To represent the distributions efficiently and nonparametrically, we employ the framework of the kernel embeddings of distributions. The embedding is estimated so as to minimize the difference between distributions of paired instances while keeping unpaired instances apart.

Like other importance sampling-based methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution. This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible, applicable to any parameterized proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich parameterizations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC significantly improves inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a latent variable recurrent neural network (LV-RNN) achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Subunit models provide a powerful yet parsimonious description of  neural spike responses to complex stimuli. They can be expressed by  a cascade of two linear-nonlinear (LN) stages, with the first linear  stage defined by convolution with one or more filters.  Recent  interest in such models has surged due to their biological  plausibility and accuracy for characterizing early sensory  responses. However, fitting subunit models poses a difficult  computational challenge due to the expense of evaluating the  log-likelihood and the ubiquity of local optima.  Here we address  this problem by forging a theoretical connection between  spike-triggered covariance analysis and nonlinear subunit models.  Specifically, we show that a &apos;&apos;convolutional&apos;&apos; decomposition of the  spike-triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) provides an  asymptotically efficient estimator for the subunit model under  certain technical conditions. We also prove the identifiability of  such convolutional decomposition under mild assumptions.  Our  moment-based methods outperform highly regularized versions of the  GQM on neural data from macaque primary visual cortex, and achieves  nearly the same prediction performance as the full  maximum-likelihood estimator, yet with substantially lower cost.</div>"

We test RFNs as pretraining technique of deep networks on different vision datasets, where RFNs were superior to RBMs and autoencoders.

Embedding based approaches make training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and hence the effective number of labels can be reduced by projecting the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications.This paper develops the SLEEC classifier to address both limitations. The main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world as well as benchmark data sets and compare our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both embeddings (by as much as 35%) as well as trees (by as much as 6%). SLEEC can also scale efficiently to data sets with a million labels which are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods.</div>"

A common way to define an out-of-sample mapping is to optimize the objective directly over a parametric mapping of the inputs, such as a neural net. This can be done using the chain rule and a nonlinear optimizer, but is very slow, because the objective involves a quadratic number of terms each dependent on the entire mapping&apos;s parameters. Using the method of auxiliary coordinates, we derive a training algorithm that works by alternating steps that train an auxiliary embedding with steps that train the mapping. This has two advantages: 1) The algorithm is universal in that a specific learning algorithm for any choice of embedding and mapping can be constructed by simply reusing existing algorithms for the embedding and for the mapping. A user can then try possible mappings and embeddings with less effort. 2) The algorithm is fast, and it can reuse N-body methods developed for nonlinear embeddings, yielding linear-time iterations.</div>"

While these algorithms are effective, it is often unnecessary and wasteful to find the global structures when we are only interested in one target variable (such as class labels). We propose a new local causal discovery algorithm, called Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), to identify the direct causes and effects of a target variable based on Markov Blanket Discovery. CMB is designed to conduct causal discovery among multiple variables, but focuses only on finding causal relationships between a specific target variable and other variables.

However, most recommendation algorithms do not explicitly take into account the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users. Two central but less explored questions are how to recommend the most desirable item \\\\emph{at the right moment}, and how to predict \\\\emph{the next returning time} of a user to a service. To address these questions, we propose a novel framework which connects self-exciting point processes and low-rank models to capture the recurrent temporal patterns in a large collection of user-item consumption pairs. We show that the parameters of the model can be estimated via a convex optimization, and furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm that maintains $O(1 / \\\\epsilon)$ convergence rate, scales up to problems with millions of user-item pairs and thousands of millions of temporal events. Compared to other state-of-the-arts in both synthetic and real datasets, our model achieves superb predictive performance in the two time-sensitive recommendation questions. Finally, we point out that our formulation can incorporate other extra context information of users, such as profile, textual and spatial features.</div>"

These lifted algorithms achieve significant complexity reductions over their propositional counterparts by using lifting rules that leverage symmetries in the relational representation. One drawback of these algorithms is that they use an inference-blind representation of the search space, which makes it difficult to efficiently pre-compute tight upper bounds on the exact cost of inference without running the algorithm to completion. In this paper, we present a principled approach to address this problem. We introduce a lifted analogue of the propositional And/Or search space framework, which we call a lifted And/Or schematic. Given a schematic-based representation of an SRM, we show how to efficiently compute a tight upper bound on the time and space cost of exact inference from a current assignment and the remaining schematic. We show how our bounding method can be used within a lifted importance sampling algorithm, in order to perform effective Rao-Blackwellisation, and demonstrate experimentally that the Rao-Blackwellised version of the algorithm yields more accurate estimates on several real-world datasets.</div>"

A key advantage of these lifted algorithms is that they have much smaller computational complexity than propositional algorithms when symmetries are present in the MLN and these symmetries can be detected using lifted inference rules. Unfortunately, lifted inference rules are sound but not complete and can often miss many symmetries. This is problematic because when symmetries cannot be exploited, lifted inference algorithms ground the MLN, and search for solutions in the much larger propositional space. In this paper, we present a novel approach, which cleverly introduces new symmetries at the time of grounding. Our main idea is to partition the ground atoms and force the inference algorithm to treat all atoms in each part as indistinguishable. We show that by systematically and carefully refining (and growing) the partitions, we can build advanced any-time and any-space MAP inference algorithms. Our experiments on several real-world datasets clearly show that our new algorithm is superior to previous approaches and often finds useful symmetries in the search space that existing lifted inference rules are unable to detect.</div>"

Among the commonly used kernels for nonlinear classification are polynomial kernels, for which low approximation error has thus far necessitated explicit feature maps of large dimensionality, especially for higher-order polynomials. Meanwhile, because polynomial kernels are unbounded, they are frequently applied to data that has been normalized to unit l2 norm. The question we address in this work is: if we know a priori that data is so normalized, can we devise a more compact map? We show that a putative affirmative answer to this question based on Random Fourier Features is impossible in this setting, and introduce a new approximation paradigm, Spherical Random Fourier (SRF) features, which circumvents these issues and delivers a compact approximation to polynomial kernels for data on the unit sphere. Compared to prior work, SRF features are less rank-deficient, more compact, and achieve better kernel approximation, especially for higher-order polynomials.

The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals are linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm, PEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for ICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite \\u201cinner product\\u201d) space. The use of this indefinite \\u201cinner product\\u201d resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm which is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing.Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct approach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for signal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA literature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction problem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact that SINR itself cannot be computed from data. That allows us to obtain a practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise.</div>"

Along the course of the proof, we also obtain two new provable guarantees for the agnostic subspace clustering and the graph connectivity problem which might be of independent interests.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Spectral embedding based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a widely used \\&quot;preprocessing\\&quot; step in many learning tasks, typically leading to dimensionality reduction by projecting onto a number of dominant singular vectors and rescaling the coordinate axes (by a predefined function of the singular value). However, the number of such vectors required to capture problem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity it compressive spectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order polynomial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an m times n matrix with T non-zeros, its time complexity is O((T+m+n)log(m+n)), and the embedding dimension is O(log(m+n)), both of which are independent of the number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to sidestepping the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks such as clustering and classification, we are only interested in using the resulting embedding to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the euclidean norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on arbitrary vectors as a partial SVD tries to do. Our numerical results on network datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, and motivate further exploration of its application to large-scale inference tasks.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Overfitting is the bane of data analysts, even when data are plentiful. Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused.  An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in (Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating expectations of adaptively chosen functions.In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout (or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a  holdout set adaptively multiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We give an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a simple synthetic experiment.We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive data analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach  in (Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis. We then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be used to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally, we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion of approximate max-information that we introduce. This, in particular, allows the preservation of statistical validity guarantees even when an analyst adaptively composes algorithms which have guarantees based on either of the two approaches.</div>"

Side information has been considered in several matrix completion applications, and is generally shown to be useful empirically.  Recently, Xu et al. studied the effect of side information for matrix completion under a theoretical viewpoint, showing that sample complexity can be significantly reduced given completely clean features.  However, since in reality most given features are noisy or even weakly informative, how to develop a general model to handle general feature set, and how much the noisy features can help matrix recovery in theory, is still an important issue to investigate. In this paper, we propose a novel model that balances between features and observations simultaneously, enabling us to leverage feature information yet to be robust to feature noise.  Moreover, we study the effectof general features in theory, and show that by using our model, the sample complexity can still be lower than matrix completion as long as features are sufficiently informative. This result provides a theoretical insight of usefulness for general side information.  Finally, we consider synthetic data and two real applications - relationship prediction and semi-supervised clustering, showing that our model outperforms other methods for matrix completion with features both in theory and practice.</div>"

Additionally, in the noisy setting, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that is also an O(1)-approximation. These algorithms are highly parallel and lend themselves to virtually any distributed computing framework.

In this setting, each party is interested in computing a function on its private bit and all the other parties&apos; bits. The function to be computed can vary from one party to the other. Moreover, there could be a central observer who is interested in computing a separate function on all the parties&apos; bits. Differential privacy ensures that there remains an uncertainty in any party&apos;s bit even when given the transcript of interactions and all other parties&apos; bits. Performance at each party is measured via the accuracy of the function to be computed. We allow for an arbitrary cost metric to measure the distortion between the true and the computed function values. Our main result is the optimality of a simple non-interactive protocol: each party randomizes its bit (sufficiently) and shares the privatized version with the other parties. This optimality result is very general: it holds for all types of functions, heterogeneous privacy conditions on the parties, all types of cost metrics, and both average and worst-case (over the inputs) measures of accuracy. </div>"

Adaptive stochastic optimization plays a crucial role in planning and learning under uncertainty, but is, unfortunately, computationally intractable in general.  This paper introduces two conditions on the objective function, the marginal likelihood rate bound and the marginal likelihood bound, which enable efficient approximate solution of adaptive stochastic optimization. Several interesting classes of functions satisfy these conditions naturally, e.g., the version space reduction function for hypothesis learning.  We describe Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC),  a new adaptive stochastic optimization algorithm that exploits these conditions, and apply it to two planning tasks under uncertainty.

Current approaches are mainly focused on learning the structure under restrictive parametric assumptions, which limits the applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the structure of a probabilistic graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. We consider probabilities that are members of an infinite dimensional exponential family, which is parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and its kernel $k$. One difficulty in learning nonparametric densities is evaluation of the normalizing constant. In order to avoid this issue, our procedure minimizes the penalized score matching objective. We show how to efficiently minimize the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure recovers the graph structure with high-probability under mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate ability of our procedure to recover the true graph structure without the knowledge of the data generating process. </div>"

In the first case we prove a PAC-Bayesian theorem, which can be seen as a direct generalization of the analogous previous result for the i.i.d. case.

This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we propose a convex, classification-calibrated loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2008] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong l2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust.

Using these techniques we generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the graph.

Our results hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only to a fixed w*, generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold for any w* \\\\in \\\\R^p.Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery. and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find TORRENT, and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery than the state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized datasets (with p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our proposed method called TORRENT-HYB is more than 20x faster than the best L1 solver.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">This article provides the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time $t_{mix}$ of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at a prescribed confidence level.  The interval is computed from a single finite-length sample path from the Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any parameters of the chain.  This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior knowledge.  The interval is constructed around the relaxation time $t_{relax}$, which is strongly related to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero roughly at a $\\\\sqrt{n}$ rate, where $n$ is the length of the sample path.  Upper and lower bounds are given on the number of samples required to achieve constant-factor multiplicative accuracy.  The lower bounds indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure can achieve this accuracy level before seeing each state at least $\\\\Omega(t_{relax})$ times on the average.  Finally, future directions of research are identified.</div>"

The proposed framework relies on constrained sensing vectors and a two-stage reconstruction method that consists of two standard convex programs that are solved sequentially.In recent years, various methods are proposed for compressive phase retrieval, but they have suboptimal sample complexity or lack robustness guarantees. The main obstacle has been that there is no straightforward convex relaxations for the type of structure in the target. Given a set of underdetermined measurements, there is a standard framework for recovering a sparse matrix, and a standard framework for recovering a low-rank matrix. However, a general, efficient method for recovering a jointly sparse and low-rank matrix has remained elusive.Deviating from the models with generic measurements, in this paper we show that if the sensing vectors are chosen at random from an incoherent subspace, then the low-rank and sparse structures of the target signal can be effectively decoupled. We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank recovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate estimate of the target when the number of measurements is $\\\\mathsf{O}(k\\\\,\\\\log\\\\frac{d}{k})$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the sparsity level and the dimension of the input signal.

In this game, the learner chooses an action and at the same time the opponent chooses an outcome, then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal. The goal of the learner is to minimize the total loss. In this paper, we study partial monitoring with finite actions and stochastic outcomes. We derive a logarithmic distribution-dependent regret lower bound that defines the hardness of the problem. Inspired by the DMED algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010) for the multi-armed bandit problem, we propose PM-DMED, an algorithm that minimizes the distribution-dependent regret. PM-DMED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in numerical experiments. To show the optimality of PM-DMED with respect to the regret bound, we slightly modify the algorithm by introducing a hinge function (PM-DMED-Hinge). Then, we derive an asymptotical optimal regret upper bound of PM-DMED-Hinge that matches the lower bound.</div>"

It was recently shown that for convex problems the classical cyclic BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent) achieves an O(1/r) complexity (r is the number of passes of all blocks). However, such bounds are at least linearly depend on $K$ (the number of variable blocks), and are at least $K$ times worse than those of the gradient descent (GD) and proximal gradient (PG) methods.In this paper, we close such theoretical performance gap between cyclic BCD and GD/PG. First we show that for a family of quadratic nonsmooth problems, the complexity bounds for cyclic Block Coordinate Proximal Gradient (BCPG), a popular variant of BCD, can match those of the GD/PG in terms of dependency on $K$ (up to a \\\\log^2(K) factor). Second, we establish an improved complexity bound for Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for general convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our bounds are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least $K$ times worse than GD. {Our analyses do not depend on the update order of block variables inside each cycle, thus our results also apply to BCD methods with random permutation (random sampling without replacement, another popular variant). </div>"

This is common practice both in machine learning, and in scientific research, in which data-sets are shared and re-used across multiple studies. Unfortunately, most of the statistical inference theory used in empirical sciences to control false discovery rates, and in machine learning to avoid overfitting, assumes a fixed class of hypotheses to test, or family of functions to optimize over, selected independently of the data. If the set of analyses run is itself a function of the data, much of this theory becomes invalid, and indeed, has been blamed as one of the causes of the crisis of reproducibility in empirical science.<br><br>Recently, there have been several exciting proposals for how to avoid overfitting and guarantee statistical validity even in general adaptive data analysis settings. The problem is important, and ripe for further advances. The goal of this workshop is to bring together members of different communities (from machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science) interested in solving this problem, to share recent results, to discuss promising directions for future research, and to foster collaborations.

These developments promise unprecedented insights into the collective dynamics of neural populations and thereby the underpinnings of brain-like computation.  However, this new large-scale regime for neural data brings significant methodological challenges. This workshop seeks to explore the statistical methods and theoretical tools that will be  necessary to study these data, build new models of neural dynamics, and increase our understanding of the underlying computation. We have invited researchers across a range of disciplines in statistics, applied physics, machine learning, and both theoretical and experimental neuroscience, with the goal of fostering interdisciplinary insights.  We hope that active discussions among these groups can set in motion new collaborations and facilitate future breakthroughs on fundamental research problems.<br><br><br>The workshop will focus on three central questions:<br><br>a) How can we deal with incomplete data in a principled manner?  In most experimental settings, even advanced neural recording methods can only sample a small fraction of all neurons that might be involved in a task, and the observations are often indirect and noisy. As a result, many recordings are from neurons that receive inputs from neurons that are not themselves directly observed, at least not over the same time period.  How can we deal with this `incomplete data&apos; problem in a principled manner?  How does this sparsity of recordings influence what we can and cannot infer about neural dynamics and mechanisms?<br><br>b) How can we incorporate existing models of neural dynamics into neural data analysis? Theoretical neuroscientists have intensely studied neural population dynamics for decades, resulting in a plethora of models of neural population dynamics. However, most analysis methods for neural data do not directly incorporate any models of neural dynamics, but rather build on generic methods for dimensionality reduction or time-series modelling. How can we incorporate existing models of neural dynamics? Conversely, how can we design neural data analysis methods such that they explicitly constrain models of neural dynamics?<br><br>c) What synergies are there between analyzing biological and artificial neural systems? The rise of \\u2018deep learning\\u2019 methods has shown that hard computational problems can be solved by machine learning algorithms that are built by cascading many nonlinear units. Although artificial neural systems are fully observable, it has proven challenging to provide a theoretical understanding of how they solve computational problems and which features of a neural network are critical for its performance. While such \\u2018deep networks\\u2019 differ from biological neural networks in many ways, they provide an interesting testing ground for evaluating strategies for understanding neural processing systems. Are there synergies between analysis methods for analyzing biological and artificial neural systems? Has the resurgence of deep learning resulted in new hypotheses or strategies for trying to understand biological neural networks?<br></div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Formal definitions of rationality are instrumental for understanding and designing intelligent systems. By specifying the optimal way to reason under the constraint of limited information, Bayesian rationality has enabled tremendous advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence together with deep insights into human cognition and brain function. Bounded optimality (Horvitz, 1989; Russell, &amp; Wefald, 1991a) extends Bayesian rationality by taking into account two additional constraints: limited time and finite computational resources. Bounded optimality is a practical framework for designing the best AI system possible given the constraints of its limited-performance hardware (Russell &amp; Subramanian, 1995), and provides a way to capture the time and resource-constraints on human cognition. To adaptively allocate their finite computational bounded agents may have to perform rational metareasoning (Russel, &amp; Wefald, 1991b) which corresponds to topics like cognitive control and metacognition studied in cognitive neuroscience and psychology.<br><br>Current research in cognitive science is leveraging bounded optimality and rational metareasoning to understand how the human mind can achieve so much with so little computation (Gershman, Horvitz, &amp; Tenenbaum, in press; Vul, Griffiths, Goodman, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2014), to develop and constrain process models of cognition (Griffiths, Lieder, &amp; Goodman, 2015; Lewis, Howes, &amp; Singh, 2014), to reevaluate the evidence for human irrationality, and to rethink heuristics and biases (Lieder, Griffiths, &amp; Goodman, 2013; Lieder, Plunkett, et al. 2015). Rational metareasoning and bounded optimality also have interesting connections to neuroscience including the top-down control of neural information processing (e.g., Shenhav, Botvinick, &amp; Cohen, 2013) and neural coding (Gershman, &amp; Wilson, 2007).<br><br>This workshop brings together computer scientists working on bounded optimality and metareasoning with psychologists and neuroscientists reverse-engineering the computational principles that make the human brain incredibly resource-efficient. The goal of this workshop is to synthesize these different perspectives on bounded optimality, to promote interdisciplinary interactions and cross-fertilization, and to identify directions for future research.<br><br>References<br>-------------<br><br>1.\\tHorvitz, E.

Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods are designed to examine complex relationships between large-dimensional signals, such as brain MRI images, and an outcome of interest, such as the category of a stimulus, with a limited amount of data. The MVPA approach is in contrast with the classical mass-univariate (MUV) approach that treats each individual imaging measurement in isolation.<br><br>Recent work in neuroscience has started to move away from conventional lab-based studies, towards more naturalistic behavioral tasks (e.g. normal reading, movie watching), with mobile neuroimaging technologies (EEG, NIRS), and real-world applications (e.g. in psychiatry, or education) that make use of other available data sources.<br><br>This trend presents challenges and opportunities for machine learning. Real world applications typically involve much larger quantities of data, which can be continuously recorded in natural environments like the classroom, home or workplace. But this data is more noisy due to the lower-spec hardware and less controlled environment. And gathering data from much broader swathes of the population, whether healthy or dealing with a condition, results in more uncontrolled variation. <br><br>ML techniques have already revolutionized analysis of well-controlled lab data, and are even more necessary for these new applications.

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Dear NIPS Workshop Chairs,<br><br>We propose to organize the workshop<br><br>   OPT2015: Optimization for Machine Learning.<br><br>As the eighth in its series, OPT 2015 builds on significant precedent established by OPT 2008--OPT 2014, all of which have been remarkably well-received NIPS workshops.<br><br>The previous OPT workshops enjoyed packed (to overpacked) attendance, and this enthusiastic reception is an attestation to the great importance of optimization within machine learning. <br>The intersection of OPT and ML has grown monotonically over the years, to the extent that now many cutting edge advances in optimization are arising from the ML community. The driving  feature is the departure of algorithms from textbook approaches, in particular by paying attention to problem specific structure and to deployability in practical (even industrial)  big-data settings.<br><br>This intimate relation of optimization with ML is the key motivation for our workshop. We wish to use OPT2015 as a platform to foster discussion, discovery, and dissemination of the state-of-the-art in optimization as relevant to machine learning.<br><br>As in the past years, the workshop will continue to bring luminaries from the field of optimization to share classical perspectives, as well as give a platform for thought leaders from machine learning to share exciting recent advances. To this end, our tentative invited speakers for this year are: Elad Hazan, Guanghui Lan and Jorge Nocedal. Additionally, we will hope to continue the tradition of high quality contributed talks and posters.<br><br><br>I. INTRODUCTION<br>   -------------<br><br>OPT workshops have previously covered a variety of topics, such as frameworks for convex programs (D. Bertsekas), the intersection of ML and optimization, especially SVM training (S. Wright), large-scale learning via stochastic gradient methods and its tradeoffs (L. Bottou, N. Srebro), exploitation of structured sparsity (Vandenberghe), randomized methods for extremely large-scale convex optimization (A. Nemirovski), complexity theoretic foundations of convex optimization (Y. Nesterov), distributed large-scale optimization (S. Boyd), asynchronous and sparsity based stochastic gradient (B. Recht), algebraic techniques in machine learning (P. Parillo), insights into nonconvex optimization (A. Lewis), sums-of-squares techniques (J. Lasserre), optimization in the context of deep learning (Y. Bengio), among others.<br><br>Several ideas propounded in these talks have become important research topics in ML and optimization --- especially in the field of randomized algorithms and stochastic gradient methods.  An edited book \\&quot;Optimization for Machine Learning\\&quot; (S. Sra, S. Nowozin, and S. Wright; MIT Press, 2011) grew out of the first three OPT workshops, and contains high-quality contributions from many of the speakers and attendees.<br><br>Much of the recent focus has been on large-scale first-order convex optimization algorithms for machine learning, both from a theoretical and methodological point of view. Covered topics included stochastic gradient algorithms, (accelerated) proximal algorithms, decomposition and coordinate descent algorithms, parallel and distributed optimization. Theoretical and practical advances in these methods remain a topic of core interest to the workshop. Recent years have also seen interesting advances in non-convex optimization such as a growing body of results on alternating minimization, tensor factorization etc.<br><br>We also do not wish to ignore the not particularly large scale setting, where one does have time to wield substantial computational resources. In this setting, high-accuracy solutions and deep understanding of the lessons contained in the data are needed. Examples valuable to MLers may be exploration of genetic and environmental data to identify risk factors for disease; or problems dealing with setups where the amount of observed data is not huge, but the mathematical model is complex. Consequently, we encourage optimization methods on manifolds, ML problems with differential geometric antecedents, those using advanced algebraic techniques, and computational topology, for instance.<br></div>"

For that reason, submissions are extended to 10 pages (excluding references and appendix) in JMLR format. The authors of accepted submissions will be asked to provide a camera-ready version within 7 days of acceptance notification.<br><br>  <br>  The problem of extracting features from given data is of critical importance for the successful application of machine learning. Feature extraction, as usually understood, seeks for an optimal transformation from raw data into features that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. In recent times this problem has been attacked using a growing number of diverse techniques that originated in separate research communities: from PCA and LDA to manifold and metric learning.  It is the goal of this workshop to provide a platform to exchange ideas and compare results across these techniques. <br><br>     The workshop will consist of three sessions, each dedicated to a specific open problem in the area of feature extraction. The sessions will start with invited talks and conclude with panel discussions, where the audience will engage into debates with speakers and organizers.<br><br>      We welcome submissions from sub-areas such as general embedding techniques, metric learning, scalable nonlinear features, deep neural networks.<br><br> More often than not, studies in each of these areas do not compare or evaluate methods found in the other areas. It is the goal of this workshop to begin the discussions needed to remedy this. We encourage submissions to foster open discussions around such important questions, which include, but are not limited to:<br><br>    1. Scalability. We have recently managed to scale up convex methods. Most remarkably, approximating kernel functions via random Fourier features have enabled kernel machines to match the DNNs. That inspired many efficient feature extraction methods, for instance Monte Carlo methods improved the results of Fourier features as well as approximating polynomial kernels via explicit feature maps showed remarkable performance. What does it all means for the prospects of convex scalable methods? Can they become state of the art in the nearest future?<br><br>     2. Convex and non-convex feature extraction. While deep nets suffer from non-convexity and the lack of theoretical guarantees, kernel machines are convex and well studied mathematically. Thus, it is extremely tempting for us to resort to kernels in understanding neural nets. Can we shed more light on their connection?<br><br>    3. Balance between extraction and classification stages. We often see in real world applications (e.g. spam detection, audio filtering) that feature extraction is CPU-heavy compared to classification. The classic way to balance them was to sparsify the choice of features with L-1 regularization. A promising alternative is to use trees of classifiers. However, this problem is NP hard, so a number of relaxations has been suggested. Which relaxations are better and will the tree-based approaches to extraction/classification tradeoff become the state of the art?<br><br>    4. Supervised vs. Unsupervised. Can we understand, which methods are most useful for particular settings and why?<br><br>    5. Theory vs. Practice: Certain methods are supported by significant theoretical guarantees, but how do these guarantees translate into performance in practice?  </div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">The ever-increasing size of data sets has resulted in an immense effort in Bayesian statistics to develop more expressive and scalable probabilistic models. Inference remains a challenge and limits the use of these models in large-scale scientific and industrial applications. Asymptotically exact schemes such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are often slow to run and difficult to evaluate in finite time. Thus we must resort to approximate inference, which allows for more efficient run times and more reliable convergence diagnostics on large-scale and streaming data\\u2014without compromising on the complexity of these models. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in order to discuss recent advances in approximate inference; we also aim to discuss the methodological and foundational issues in such techniques in order to consider future improvements.<br><br>The resurgence of interest in approximate inference has furthered development in many techniques: for example, scalability, variance reduction, and preserving dependency in variational inference; divide and conquer techniques in expectation propagation; dimensionality reduction using random projections; and stochastic variants of Laplace approximation-based methods. Approximate inference techniques have clearly emerged as the preferred way to perform tractable Bayesian inference. Despite this interest, there remain significant trade-offs in speed, accuracy, generalizability, and learned model complexity. In this workshop, we will discuss how to rigorously characterize these tradeoffs, as well as how they might be made more favourable. Moreover, we will address the issues of its adoption in scientific communities which could benefit from advice on their practical usage and the development of relevant software packages.</div>"

More than ever before, we have access to massive datasets in almost every area of science and engineering, including genomics, robotics, and climate science.  This wealth of information provides an unprecedented opportunity to automatically learn rich representations of data, which allows us to greatly improve performance in predictive tasks, but also provides a mechanism for scientific discovery.  That is, by automatically learning expressive representations of data, versus carefully hand crafting features, we can obtain a new theoretical understanding of our modelling problems.  Recently, deep learning architectures have had success for such representation learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing.<br><br>Expressive non-parametric methods also have great potential for large-scale structure discovery; indeed, these methods can be highly flexible, and have an information capacity that grows with the amount of available data.  However, there are practical challenges involved in developing non-parametric methods for large scale representation learning.<br><br>Consider, for example, kernel methods.  A kernel controls the generalisation properties of these methods.  A well chosen kernel leads to impressive empirical performances. Difficulties arise when the kernel is a priori unknown and the number of datapoints is large.  One must develop an expressive kernel learning approach, and scaling such an approach poses different challenges than scaling a standard kernel method. One faces additional computational constraints, and the need to retain significant model structure for expressing the rich information available in a large dataset.  However, the need for expressive kernel learning on large datasets is especially great, since such datasets often provide more information to automatically learn an appropriate statistical representation.<br><br>This 1 day workshop is about non-parametric methods for large scale structure learning, including automatic pattern discovery, extrapolation, manifold learning, kernel learning, metric learning, data compression, feature extraction, trend filtering, and dimensionality reduction. Non-parametric methods include, for example, Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, Indian buffet processes, and support vector machines.  We are particularly interested in developing scalable and expressive methods to derive new scientific insights from large datasets. A poster session, coffee breaks, and a panel guided discussion will encourage interaction between attendees.   This workshop aims to bring together researchers wishing to explore alternatives to neural networks for learning rich non-linear function classes, with an emphasis on nonparametric methods, representation learning and scalability. We wish to carefully review and enumerate modern approaches to these challenges, share insights into the underlying properties of these methods, and discuss future directions.</div>"

The role of modeling in healthcare is two-fold. First, it provides clinicians with a tool to aid exploration of hypotheses in a data-driven way.

Examples include machine learning of disease progression models, where patients and diseases are characterized by states that evolve over time, or dose-response models, where the treatment details involving complex and often combinatorial therapies can be inferred in a data driven way to optimally treat individual patients. Such methods face many statistical challenges such as accounting for confounding effects like socioeconomic backgrounds or genetic alterations in subpopulations.

See <a href=\"http://www.netadis.eu/\">http://www.netadis.eu</a> for further information and workshop details (NIPS 2015 tab).\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Workshop overview</b>\\n<br>\\nInference and learning on large graphical models, i.e. large systems of simple probabilistic units linked by a complex network of interactions, is a classical topic in machine learning. Such systems are also an active research topic in the field of statistical physics. \\n<br>\\n<br>\\nThe main interaction between statistical physics and machine learning has so far been in the area of analysing data sets without explicit temporal structure. Here methods of equilibrium statistical physics, developed for studying Boltzmann distributions on networks of nodes with e.g. pairwise interactions, are closely related to graphical model inference techniques; accordingly there has been much cross-fertilization leading to both conceptual insights and more efficient algorithms. Models can be learned from recorded experimental or other empirical data, but even when samples come from e.g. a time series this aspect of the data is typically ignored. \\n<br>\\n<br>\\nMore recently, interest has shifted towards <b>dynamical models</b>. This shift has occurred for two main reasons:\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n(a) Most of the interesting systems for which statistical analysis techniques are required, e.g. networks of biological neurons, gene regulatory networks, protein-protein interaction networks, stock markets, exhibit very rich temporal or spatiotemporal dynamics; if this is ignored by focusing on stationary distributions alone this can lead to the loss of a significant amount of interesting information and possibly even qualitatively wrong conclusions.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n(b) Current technological breakthroughs in collecting data from the complex systems referred to above are yielding ever increasing temporal resolution. This in turn allows in depth analyses of the fundamental temporal aspects of the function of the system, if combined with strong theoretical methods. It is widely accepted that these dynamical aspects are crucial for understanding the function of biological and financial systems, warranting the development of techniques for studying them. \\n<br>\\n<br>\\nIn the past, the fields of machine learning and statistical physics have  cross-fertilised each other significantly. E.g. the establishment of the relation between loopy belief propagation, message passing algorithms and the Bethe free energy formulation has stimulated a large amount of research in approximation techniques for inference and the corresponding equilibrium analysis of disordered systems in statistical physics.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nIt is the goal of the proposed workshop to bring together researchers from the fields of machine learning and statistical physics in order to discuss the new challenges originating from dynamical data. Such data are modelled using a variety of approaches such as dynamic belief networks, continuous time analogues of these \\u2013 as often used for disordered spin systems in statistical physics \\u2013, coupled stochastic differential equations for continuous random variables etc. The workshop will provide a forum for exploring possible synergies between the inference and learning approaches developed for the various models. The experience from joint advances in the equilibrium domain suggests that there is much unexplored scope for progress on dynamical data.<br><br>Possible topics to be addressed will be:\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Inference on state dynamics:</b>\\n<br>\\n- efficient approximation of dynamics on a given network, filtering, smoothing\\n<br>\\n- inference with hidden nodes\\n<br>\\n- existing methods including dynamical belief propagation &amp; expectation propagation, variational approximations, mean-field and Plefka approximations; relations between these, advantages, drawbacks\\n<br>\\n- alternative approaches\\n<br>\\n<br><br><br><b>Learning model/network parameters: </b>\\n<br>\\n- with/without hidden nodes\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Learning network structure:</b>\\n<br>\\n- going beyond correlation information\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Abstracts of invited talks</b>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Jose Bento</b>: Learning Stochastic Differential Equations \\u2013 Fundamental limits and efficient algorithms\\n<br>\\nModels based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) play a crucial role in several domains of science and technology, ranging from chemistry to finance.\\nIn this talk I consider the problem of learning the drift coefficient of a p-dimensional stochastic differential equation from a sample path of length T. I assume that the drift is parametrized by a high dimensional vector, and study the support recovery problem in the case where p is allowed to grow with T.\\nIn particular, I describe a general lower bound on the sample-complexity T by using a characterization of mutual information as time integral of conditional variance, due to Kadota, Zakai, and Ziv. For linear stochastic differential equations, the drift coefficient is parametrized by a p by p matrix which describes which degrees of freedom interact under the dynamics. In this case, I analyze an L1-regularized least-squares estimator and describe an upper bound on T that nearly matches the lower bound on specific classes of sparse matrices.\\nI describe how this same algorithm can be used to learn non-linear SDEs and in addition show by means of a numerical experiment why one should expect the sample-complexity to be of the same order as that for linear SDEs.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Alfredo Braunstein</b>: Bayesian inference of cascades on networks\\n<br>\\nWe present a method based on Belief Propagation to study a series of inference problems on discrete dynamical cascade models based on partial and/or noisy observations of the cascades. The problems include the identification of the source, the discovery of undetected infected nodes, prediction of features of the future evolution, and the inference of the supporting network.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Ramon Grima</b>: Exact and approximate solutions for spatial stochastic models of chemical systems\\n<br>\\nStochastic effects in chemical reaction systems have been mostly studied via the chemical master equation, a non-spatial discrete stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics which assumes well-mixing and point-like interactions between molecules. These assumptions are in direct contrast with what experiments tells us about the nature of the intracellular environment, namely that diffusion plays a fundamental role in intracellular dynamics and that the environment itself is highly non-dilute (or crowded). I will here describe our recent work on obtaining (i) exact expressions for the solution of the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) and its crowded counterpart (cRDME) in equilibrium conditions and (ii) approximate expressions for the moments in non-equilibrium conditions. The solutions portray an emerging picture of the combined influence of diffusion and crowding on the stochastic properties of chemical reaction networks.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Jakob Macke</b>: Correlations and signatures of criticality in neural population models\\n<br>\\nLarge-scale recording methods make it possible to measure the statistics of neural population activity, and thereby to gain insights into the principles that govern the collective activity of neural ensembles. One hypothesis that has emerged from this approach is that neural populations are poised at a \\u2018thermo-dynamic critical point\\u2019, and that this has important functional consequences (Tkacik et al 2014). Support for this hypothesis has come from studies that computed the specific heat, a measure of global population statistics, for groups of neurons subsampled from population recordings. These studies have found two effects which\\u2014in physical systems\\u2014indicate a critical point: First, specific heat diverges with population size N. Second, when manipulating population statistics by introducing a \\u2019temperature\\u2019 in analogy to statistical mechanics, the maximum heat moves towards unit-temperature for large populations. \\nWhat mechanisms can explain these observations? We show that both effects arise in a simple simulation of retinal population activity. They robustly appear across a range of parameters including biologically implausible ones, and can be understood analytically in simple models. The specific heat grows with N whenever the (average) correlation is independent of N, which is always true when uniformly subsampling a large, correlated population. For weakly correlated populations, the rate of divergence of the specific heat is proportional to the correlation strength. Thus, if retinal population codes were optimized to maximize specific heat, then this would predict that they seek to increase correlations. This is incongruent with theories of efficient coding that make the opposite prediction. We find criticality in a simple and parsimonious model of retinal processing, and without the need for fine-tuning or adaptation. This suggests that signatures of criticality might not require an optimized coding strategy, but rather arise as consequence of sub-sampling a stimulus-driven neural population (Aitchison et al 2014).\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Andrea Montanari</b>: Information-theoretic bounds on learning network dynamics\\n<br>\\nHow long should we observe the trajectory of a system before being able to characterize its underlying network dynamics? I will present a brief review of information-theoretic tools to establish lower bounds on the required length of observation.  I will illustrate the use of these tools with a few examples: linear and nonlinear stochastic differential equations, dynamical Bayesian networks \\nand so on. For each of these examples, I will discuss whether the ultimate information limit has been achieved by practical algorithms or not.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Graham Taylor</b>: Learning Multi-scale Temporal Dynamics with Recurrent Neural Networks\\n<br>\\nThe last three years have seen an explosion of activity studying recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a generalization of feedforward neural networks which can map sequences to sequences. Training RNNs using backpropagation through time can be difficult, and was thought up until recently to be hopeless due to vanishing and exploding gradients used in training. Recent advances in optimization methods and architectures have led to impressive results in modeling speech, handwriting and language. Applications to other areas are emerging. In this talk, I will review some recent progress on RNNs and discuss our work on extending and improving the Clockwork RNN (Koutnick et al.), a simple yet powerful model that partitions its hidden units to model specific temporal scales. Our \\u201cDense clockworks\\u201d are a shift-invariant form of the architecture which which we show to be more efficient and effective than their predecessor. I will also describe a recent collaboration with Google in which we apply Dense clockworks to authenticating mobile phone users based on the movement of the device as captured by the accelerometer and gyroscope.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">The emergence of virtual personal assistants such as SIRI, Cortana, Echo, and Google Now, is generating increasing interest in research in speech understanding and spoken interaction. However, whilst the ability of these agents to recognise conversational speech is maturing rapidly, their ability to understand and interact is still limited to a few specific domains, such as weather information, local businesses, and some simple chit-chat. Their conversational capabilities are not necessarily apparent to users. Interaction typically depends on handcrafted scripts and is often guided by simple commands. Deployed dialogue models do not fully make use of the large amount of data that these agents generate. Promising approaches that involve statistical models, big data analysis, representation of knowledge (hierarchical, relations, etc. ), utilising and enriching semantic graphs with natural language components, multi-modality, etc. are being explored in multiple communities, such as natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, machine learning (ML), and information retrieval. However, we are still only scratching the surface in this field. The aim of this workshop, therefore, is to bring together researchers interested in understanding and interaction in conversational agents, to discuss the challenges and new and emerging topics in machine learning which might lead to richer and more natural human-computer interaction.<br><br>Obtaining meaning from human natural language is a complex process. The potential range of topics is vast and even well-formed utterances can be syntactically and semantically ambiguous. Spontaneous conversational speech naturally contains grammatical errors, repetitions, disfluencies, partial words, and out of vocabulary words. Conducting intelligent conversation over multiple turns requires maintaining the dialogue state over time, dealing with errors that arise from the speech recogniser, determining an adequate dialogue strategy, estimating the quality of that strategy, and generating natural language responses.<br><br>Over the years many different approaches and models have been proposed (e.g. syntactic and semantic analysis of spoken text, hybrid models that use speech processing components as features for semantic analysis, learning representations for spoken text, contextual models, statistical models of dialogue). These methods have drawn inspiration from machine learning solutions e.g. sequence tagging, syntactic parsing, and language modelling, primarily because these tasks can be easily abstracted into machine learning formulations (e.g. structured prediction, dimensionality reduction, regression, classification, supervised or reinforcement learning). These representations have evolved into novel understanding models based on discriminative methods, Bayesian nonparametrics, neural networks, low rank/spectral techniques, and word/phrase/sentence level embeddings based on deep learning methods.<br><br>In dialogue modelling, methods based on partially observable Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning have enabled limited domain dialogue models to be built that are trainable from data, robust to noise, and adaptable to changes in the user or domain. Following success in other areas, neural networks have also been applied to different aspects of dialogue modelling yielding significant improvements. The problem remains however as to how to extend these models to exploit the huge datasets that users of virtual personal assistants generate, and thereby enable the richer and more reliable conversation that users expect. Problems in spoken language understanding and dialogue modelling are particularly appealing to those doing core ML research due to the high-dimensional nature of the spaces involved (both the data and the label spaces), the need to handle noise robustly and the availability of large amounts of unstructured data. But there are many other areas within spoken language understanding and dialogue modelling for conversational systems where the ML community is less involved and which remain relatively unexplored, such as semantics, open-domain dialogue models, multi-modal dialogue input and output, emotion recognition, finding relational structures, discourse and pragmatics analysis, multi-human understanding (meetings) and summarization, and cross lingual understanding. These areas continue to rely on linguistically-motivated but imprecise heuristics which may benefit from new machine learning approaches.<br><br>The goal of this workshop is to bring together both applied and theoretical researchers in spoken/natural language processing and machine learning to facilitate the discussion of new frameworks that can help advance modern conversational systems. Some key questions we will address include (but are not limited to): <br><br>* Representation/Optimization <br>How can ML help provide novel representations and models to capture the structure of spoken natural language especially considering spontaneous conversational speech? <br>What speech and NLP problems could benefit from new inference/optimization techniques? <br>* Data <br>In speech and NLP we typically have large amounts of less useful background data and small amounts of very useful in-domain data. Are current ML algorithms sufficient to gracefully deal with this problem? For example, can we harness non-dialogue data to build dialogue models? <br>While many speech and NLP problems depend mainly on static speech or text corpora, dialogue is unique in that the user provides an opportunity for learning on-line. Which non-intrusive methods can we use to engage the user is such a way that it leads to improvement of the dialogue models? <br>How can we design new ML paradigms (e.g., bootstrapping, semi-supervised learning) to address the lack of annotated data in complex structured prediction problems such as knowledge extraction and semantics?<br><br>* Scalability <br>So far ML-based dialogue systems have only tacked limited domains, how can we scale them to large open domains leveraging the semantic web? <br>How can we tackle \\&quot;scalability bottlenecks\\&quot; unique to natural language? <br><br>* Multi-lingual/Multi-human/Multi-modal conversation<br>Can adaptation methods be developed to build conversational understanding systems for low resource languages without going through rigorous annotation processes? <br>What technical challenges posed by multilinguality, lexical variation in social media, and nonstandard dialects are under-researched in ML? <br>What ML methods are needed for structural understanding of multi-human conversations? <br>What ML methods can we deploy to support multi-modal conversation?</div>"

However, despite the ubiquity of such data, the vast majority of learning algorithms have been primarily developed for the setting in which sample points are drawn i.i.d. from some possibly unknown fixed distribution. While there exist algorithms designed to handle non-i.i.d. data, these typically assume specific parametric form of data-generating distribution. Such assumptions may undermine the possibly complex nature of modern data which can possess long-range dependency patterns that we now have the computing power to discern. On the other extreme, some online learning algorithms consider a non-stochastic framework without any distributional assumptions. However, such methods may fail to fully address the stochastic aspect of real-world time-series data.<br><br>The goal of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and applied researchers interested in the analysis of time series, and the development of new algorithms to process sequential data. This includes algorithms for time series prediction, classification, clustering, anomaly and change point detection, correlation discovery, dimensionality reduction as well as a general theory for learning and comparing stochastic processes.

In each field of study scientists go from raw measurements (celestial objects spectra or energies of detected particles inside collider detectors) to higher levels of the representation that are more suitable for further analysis and to human perception.

In particular, nonparametric classification and regression are now routinely used as parts of the reconstruction (inference) chain.

Systems implementing Bayesian optimization techniques have been successfully used to solve difficult problems in a diverse set of applications. There have been many recent advances in the methodologies and theory underpinning Bayesian optimization that have extended the framework to new applications as well as provided greater insights into the behaviour of these algorithms. Bayesian optimization is now increasingly being used in industrial settings, providing new and interesting challenges that require new algorithms and theoretical insights.<br><br>At last year\\u2019s NIPS workshop on Bayesian optimization the focus was on the intersection of \\u201cacademia and industry\\u201d. Following up on this theme, the workshop this year will focus on scaling existing approaches to larger evaluation budgets, higher-dimensional search spaces, and more complex input spaces. While the computational complexity of common probabilistic regression models used in Bayesian optimization have confined it to relatively low-dimensional problems and small evaluation budgets, there have, in recent years, been several advances in scaling these probabilistic models to more demanding application domains. Furthermore, many applications of Bayesian optimization only make sense when considering concurrent evaluations, which departs from the traditional, strictly sequential Bayesian optimization framework. Recent theoretical and practical efforts have addressed the mini-batch, or parallel, evaluation framework.<br><br>The goal of this workshop is to bring together advances in scalable and flexible probabilistic modelling, and batch exploration strategies to establish the state of the art in Bayesian optimization capabilities. Specifically, we will invite participants of the workshop to share their experiences and findings in applying Bayesian optimization at new scales and in new application domains. In addition, we wish to attract researchers from the broader scientific community in order to demonstrate the flexibility of Bayesian optimization and invite them to consider including it in their own experimental methodology. The key questions we will discuss are: how to successfully scale Bayesian optimization to large evaluation budgets? How to tackle high-dimensional or complex search spaces? How to apply Bayesian optimization in massive, distributed settings?<br><br>The target audience for this workshop consists of both industrial and academic practitioners of Bayesian optimization as well as researchers working on theoretical advances in probabilistic global optimization. To this end we have invited many industrial users of Bayesian optimization to attend and speak at the workshop. We expect this exchange of industrial and academic knowledge will lead to a significant interchange of ideas and a clearer understanding of the challenges and successes of Bayesian optimization as a whole.<br><br>A further goal is to encourage collaboration between the diverse set of researchers involved in Bayesian optimization.

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Problems involving networks and massive network datasets motivate some of the most difficult and exciting inferential challenges in the social and information sciences. Modern network datasets in these areas represent complex relationships with rich information on vertex attributes, edge weights, multiple types of vertices and characteristics, all of which may be changing over time. These datasets are often enormous in size, detail, and heterogeneity, pushing the limits of existing inferential frameworks, while also requiring detailed domain knowledge in order to support useful inferences or predictions. Much progress has been made on developing rigorous tools for analyzing and modeling some types of large real-world social and information network datasets, but often this progress is distributed across disparate applied and theoretical domains. Network analysis is still a young and highly cross-disciplinary field, and the goal of this workshop is to promote cross-pollination between its constituent research communities. <br><br>In particular, this workshop aims to bring together a diverse and cross-disciplinary set of researchers to discuss recent advances and future directions for developing new network methods in statistics and machine learning. By network methods, we broadly include those models and algorithms whose goal is to learn the patterns of interaction, flow of information, or propagation of effects in social and information systems. We also welcome empirical studies, particularly attempts to bridge observational methods and causal inference, and studies that combine learning, networks, and computational social science. We are also interested in research that unifies the study of both structure and content in rich network datasets.<br><br>While this research field is already broad and diverse, there are emerging signs of convergence, maturation, and increased methodological awareness. For example, in the study of information diffusion, social media and social network researchers are beginning to use rigorous tools to distinguish effects driven by social influence, homophily, or external processes \\u2014 subjects historically of intense interest amongst statisticians and social scientists. Similarly, there is a growing statistics literature developing learning approaches to study topics popularized earlier within the physics community, including clustering in graphs, network evolution, and random-graph models. Finally, learning methods are increasingly used in highly complex application domains, such as large-scale knowledge graph construction and use, and massive social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. These applications are stimulating new scientific and practical questions that often cut across disciplinary boundaries.</div>"

The morning portion of the workshop will be organized into three hour-long sessions. Each session will start with a 30 minute overview of an experimental method, presented by a leading experimentalist in this area. Afterwards, we will have a 20 minute follow up from a computational scientist that will highlight the computational challenges associated with the technique.<br><br>In the afternoon, the goal will be to delve deeper into the kinds of techniques that will be needed to make sense of the data described in the morning. To highlight two computational approaches that we believe hold promise, we will have two 50 minute long methods talks. These talks will be followed by a scientist with big-data experience outside of neuroscience with the goal of thinking about organization, objectives, and pitfalls. Lastly we will have plenty of time for free form discussion and hold a poster session (open call for poster submissions).

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">In the next few years, traditional single agent architectures will be more and more replaced by actual multi-agent systems with components that have increasing autonomy and computational power. This transformation has already started with prominent examples such as power networks, where each node is now an active energy generator, robotic swarms of unmaned aerial vehicles, software agents that trade and negotiate on the Internet or robot assistants that need to interact with other robots or humans. The number of agents in these systems can range from a few complex agents up to several hundred if not thousands of typically much simpler entities.<br>Multi-agent systems show many beneficial properties such as robustness, scalability, paralellization and a larger number of tasks that can be achieved in comparison to centralized, single agent architectures. However, the use of multi-agent architectures represents a major paradigm shift for systems design. In order to use such systems efficiently, effective approaches for planning, learning, inference and communication are required. The agents need to plan with their local view on the world and to coordinate at multiple levels. They also need to reason about the knowledge, observations and intentions of other agents, which can in turn be cooperative or adversarial. Multi-agent learning algorithms need to deal inherently with non-stationary environments and find valid policies for interacting with the other agents.<br>Many of these requirements are inherently hard problems and computing their optimal solutions is intractable. Yet, problems can become tractable again by considering approximate solutions that can exploit certain properties of a multi-agent system. Examples of such properties are sparse interactions that only occur between locally neighbored agents or limited information to make decisions (bounded rationality).<br><br>Goal:<br><br>The fundamental challenges of this paradigm shift span many areas such as machine learning, robotics, game theory and complex networks. This workshop will serve as an inclusive forum for the discussion on ongoing or completed work in both theoretical and practical issues related to the learning, inference and control aspects of multi-agent systems</div>"

Challenge participants range from undergraduate students to retirees, joining forces in a rewarding environment allowing them to learn, perform research, and demonstrate excellence. Therefore challenges can be used as a means of directing research, advancing the state-of-the-art or venturing in completely new domains. <br><br>Because challenges have become stream line in the execution of Machine Learning projects, it has become increasingly important to regularly bring together workshop organizers, platform providers, and participants to discuss best practices in challenge organization and new methods and application opportunities to design high impact challenges.

We are particularly interested in following progresses made in two conceptually important directions:<br>1) Open innovation: Organization of contests in which data are made available and the contestants must both formalize and solve a problem (with some constraints), leaving more freedom to creativity, while giving more difficulty to the organizers to objectively assess the results.<br>2) Coopetitions: Organization of contests encouraging both collaboration and competition, in an effort to make possible the contributions of many towards a the grand goal of solving the overall problem; this poses to the organizers the problem of rewarding partial contributions.<br><br>We also want to closely follow more technical, albeit important aspects:<br>3) Platforms: New developments including \\&quot;code submission\\&quot; (platforms and protocols permitting code submission, as opposed to result submission, allowing fairer standardized comparisons in terms of hardware utilization and easier reproducibility) and \\&quot; worksheets\\&quot; or \\&quot;scripts\\&quot; facilitating code sharing.<br>4) Sharing, dissemination, and recognition: Facilitate sharing resources, including data, means of data collection and annotation, challenge announcements, best practices, challenge templates, publication channels, etc.; creation of awards to recognize academic services rendered by the various actors of challenge organization.</div>"

While there have been recent developments in accelerated inference for Bayesian nonparametric models, many approaches are not appropriate for large datasets. Further, while we have seen a growth in models for applied problems that move beyond the foundational Dirichlet and Gaussian processes, the widespread adoption of BNP methods has been limited in applied fields. In this workshop, we will address the modeling, theoretical, and computational challenges limiting adoption and how they can be circumvented. In particular, we will engage with applications specialists to better understand the best directions for BNP development as a tool for conducting applied research. We will explore computational tools for posterior inference algorithms that address the unique challenges of BNP methods including high/infinite-dimensionality and flexibility: e.g., MCMC, SMC, variational methods, and small-variance asymptotics to name a few. We will also consider the design and implementation of software to perform Bayesian nonparametric analyses, both for detailed use by experts in the field and for automatic use by researchers outside the field.<br><br>This workshop will bring together core researchers in BNP across a number of fields (machine learning, statistics, engineering, applied mathematics, etc.) with researchers working in a variety of application domains. We aim to focus on the next generation of BNP research by highlighting the contributions of younger researchers in the BNP community. We anticipate that participants will leave the workshop with (i) a foundation for understanding BNP methods, (ii) a perspective on recent advances in the field via a number of invited and contributed talks as well as poster presentations, and (iii) an idea of the challenges facing the field and future opportunities via talks and a panel discussion featuring experts both within and outside of the BNP community.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\"> Non-convex optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning. In general, reaching the global optima of these problems is NP-hard and in practice, local search methods such as gradient descent can get stuck in spurious local optima and suffer from poor convergence.<br><br>Over the last few years, tremendous progress has been made in establishing theoretical guarantees for many of the non-convex optimization problems. While there are worst-case instances which are computationally hard to solve, focus has shifted in characterizing transparent conditions for cases which are tractable. In many instances, these conditions turn out to be mild and natural for machine learning applications. <br><br>One area of non-convex optimization which has attracted extensive interest is spectral learning.  This involves finding spectral decomposition of  matrices and tensors which correspond to moments of a multivariate distribution. These algorithms are guaranteed to recover a consistent solution to parameter estimation problem in many latent variable models such as topic admixture models, HMMs, ICA, and most recently, even non-linear models such as neural networks. In contrast to traditional algorithms like expectation maximization (EM), these algorithms come with polynomial computational and sample complexity guarantees. Analysis of these methods involves understanding the optimization landscape for tensor algebraic structures.<br><br>As another example of guaranteed  non-convex methods, there has been interest in the problem of dictionary learning, which involves expressing the observed data as a sparse combination of dictionary elements. Recent results have established that both the dictionary and the coefficients can be consistently recovered in the challenging overcomplete case, where the number of dictionary elements can exceed the input dimensionality. <br><br>There is also interest in analyzing online algorithms for non-convex methods. A recent work has established that the simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with appropriately added noise can escape the saddle points and converge to a local optimum in bounded time for a large class of nonconvex problems. This is especially important since non-convex problems usually suffer from an exponential number of saddle points. <br><br>Finally, recent years have also seen novel applications of non-convex methods with rigorous guarantees. For example, many of these methods have shown great promise in diverse application domains such as natural language processing, social networks, health informatics, and biological sequence analysis. <br><br>There are certainly many challenging open problems in the area of non-convex optimization. While guarantees have been established in individual instances, there is no common unifying theme of what makes non-convex problem tractable. Many challenging instances such as optimization for training multi-layer neural networks or analyzing novel regularization techniques such as dropout for non-convex optimization still remain wide open. On the practical side, conversations between theorists and practitioners can help identify what kind of conditions are reasonable for specific applications, and thus lead to the design of practically motivated algorithms for non-convex optimization with rigorous guarantees.<br><br>This workshop will fill a very important gap in bringing researchers from disparate communities and bridging the gap between theoreticians and practitioners. To facilitate discussion between theorists and practitioners, we aim to make the workshop easily accessible to people currently unfamiliar with the intricate details of these methods. We plan to have an open problems session and a discussion session to spur further research in this area. There will also be invited poster session from top active student researchers in the area to increase  quality participation in the workshop. <br></div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">    The field of computational biology has seen dramatic growth over the past few years. A wide range of high-throughput technologies developed in the last decade now enable us to measure parts of a biological system at various resolutions\\u2014at the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome levels. These technologies are now being used to collect data for an ever-increasingly diverse set of problems, ranging from classical problems such as predicting differentially regulated genes between time points and predicting subcellular localization of RNA and proteins, to models that explore complex mechanistic hypotheses bridging the gap between genetics and disease, population genetics and transcriptional regulation. Fully realizing the scientific and clinical potential of these data requires developing novel supervised and unsupervised learning methods that are scalable, can accommodate heterogeneity, are robust to systematic noise and confounding factors, and provide mechanistic insights. <br><br>       The goals of this workshop are to i) present emerging problems and innovative machine learning techniques in computational biology, and ii) generate discussion on how to best model the intricacies of biological data and synthesize and interpret results in light of the current work in the field. We will invite several rising leaders from the biology/bioinformatics community who will present current research problems in computational biology and lead these discussions based on their own research and experiences. We will also have the usual rigorous screening of contributed talks on novel learning approaches in computational biology. We encourage contributions describing either progress on new bioinformatics problems or work on established problems using methods that are substantially different from established alternatives. Kernel methods, graphical models, feature selection, non-parametric models and other techniques applied to relevant bioinformatics problems would all be appropriate for the workshop. We are particularly keen on considering contributions related to the prediction of functions from genotypes and that target data generated from novel technologies such as gene editing and single cell genomics, though we will consider all submissions that highlight applications of machine learning into computational biology. The targeted audience are people with interest in learning and applications to relevant problems from the life sciences, including NIPS participants without any existing research link to computational biology.</div>"

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">In recent years, there have been ever-increasing demands for data-intensive scientific research. Routine use of digital sensors, high throughput experiments, and intensive computer simulations have created a data deluge imposing new challenges on scientific communities that attempt to process and analyze such data. This is especially challenging for scientific studies that involve Bayesian methods, which typically require computationally intensive Monte Carlo algorithms for their implementation. As a result, although Bayesian methods provide a robust and principled framework for analyzing data, their relatively high computational cost for Big Data problems has limited their application. The objective of this workshop is to discuss the advantages of Bayesian inference in the age of Big Data and to introduce new scalable Monte Carlo\\u00a0methods that address computational challenges in Bayesian analysis. This is a follow up to our recent workshop on Bayesian Inference for Big Data (BIBiD 2015) at Oxford University (https://github.com/BigBayes/bigbayes.github.io/wiki/BIBiD-2015). It will consist of invited and contributed talks, poster spotlights, and a poster session.

        "description": "<div class=\"\\&quot;usertext\\&quot;\">Motivation and Objective of the Workshop<br><br>In order to solve AI, a key component is the use of long term dependencies as well as short term context during inference, i.e., the interplay of reasoning, attention and memory. The machine learning community has had great success in the last decades at solving basic prediction tasks such as text classification, image annotation and speech recognition. However, solutions to deeper reasoning tasks have remained elusive. Until recently, most existing machine learning models have lacked an easy way to read and write to part of a (potentially very large) long-term memory component, and to combine this seamlessly with inference. To combine memory with reasoning, a model must learn how to access it, i.e. to perform *attention* over its memory. Within the last year or so, in part inspired by some earlier works [8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19], there has been some notable progress in these areas which this workshop addresses. Models developing notions of attention [12, 5, 6, 7, 20, 21] have shown positive results on a number of real-world tasks such as machine translation and image captioning. There has also been a surge in building models of computation which explore differing forms of explicit storage [1, 10, 11, 13, 17]. For example, recently it was shown how to learn a model to sort a small set of numbers [1] as well as a host of other symbolic manipulation tasks. Another promising direction is work employing a large long-term memory for reading comprehension; the capability of somewhat deeper reasoning has been shown on synthetic data [2], and promising results are starting to appear on real data [3,4].<br><br>In spite of this resurgence, the research into developing learning algorithms combining these components and the analysis of those algorithms is still in its infancy. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas which could lead to addressing the various drawbacks associated with such models leading to more interesting models in the quest for moving towards true AI. We thus plan to focus on addressing the following issues:<br><br>* How to decide what to write and what not to write in the memory.<br>* How to represent knowledge to be stored in memories.<br>* Types of memory (arrays, stacks, or stored within weights of model), when they should be used, and how can they be learnt.<br>* How to do fast retrieval of relevant knowledge from memories when the scale is huge.<br>* How to build hierarchical memories, e.g. employing multiscale notions of attention.<br>* How to build hierarchical reasoning, e.g. via composition of functions.<br>* How to incorporate forgetting/compression of information which is not important.<br>* How to properly evaluate reasoning models. Which tasks can have a proper coverage and also allow for unambiguous interpretation of systems&apos; capabilities? Are artificial tasks a convenient way?<br>* Can we draw inspiration from how animal or human memories are stored and used?<br><br>The workshop will devote most of the time in invited speaker talks, contributed talks and panel discussion. In order to move away from a mini-conference effect we will not have any posters. To encourage interaction a webpage will be employed for realtime updates, also allowing people to post questions before or during the workshop, which will be asked at the end of talks or during the panel, or can be answered online.<br><br>Please see our external page for more information: http://www.jaseweston.com/ram<br></div>"
